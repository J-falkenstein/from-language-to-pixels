Ascii art is a form of visual representation created using characters from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character set. It is a simple yet expressive way to create images, logos, or illustrations using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Ascii art is popularly used in computer graphics, online forums, and text-based applications.

In ascii art, the basic building blocks are characters from the ASCII character set, which includes symbols like letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and even whitespace characters. By arranging these characters in a specific pattern and sequence, one can create recognizable images or convey complex ideas. The positioning of characters within a grid-like structure, such as a rectangular or square matrix, allows the creation of visual compositions.

Here is an example of an ascii art showing a smiley face:
      _.-'''''-._
    .'  _     _  '.
   /   (_)   (_)   \
  |  ,           ,  |
  |  \`.       .`/  |
   \  '.`'""'"`.'  /
    '.  `'---'`  .'
      '-._____.-'
