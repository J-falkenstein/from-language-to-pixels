Images are represented as pixel matrices, where each pixel is a small unit of the image that stores information about its color. These images are widely used in digital photography, computer graphics, and display technologies. Here's how images are represented as pixel matrices:

Pixels:
A pixel, short for "picture element," is the smallest discrete element of an image. It is a square or rectangular point that represents a single color.
Each pixel contains information about its color, which is typically represented using the RGB color model.

RGB Color Model:
The RGB color model is an additive color model that represents colors by combining various intensities of red, green, and blue light.
Each pixel in an image is represented as a combination of these three primary colors.
For each pixel, there are three color channels: one for red, one for green, and one for blue. These channels store the intensity values for each color component.

Encoding RGB Colors:
In an RGB image, each color channel is typically represented using 8 bits, allowing for 256 different intensity levels for each color (0 to 255).
The combination of these three 8-bit channels creates a wide range of colors. For example:
(0, 0, 0) represents black (no intensity in any color).
(255, 0, 0) represents pure red (maximum intensity in red, no intensity in green or blue).
(0, 255, 0) represents pure green (maximum intensity in green, no intensity in red or blue).
(0, 0, 255) represents pure blue (maximum intensity in blue, no intensity in red or green).
(255, 255, 255) represents white (maximum intensity in all three colors).
Any combination of these intensity values in the three color channels can create a wide spectrum of colors.

Pixel Matrix:
An RGB image is essentially a grid of pixels, where each pixel is assigned a specific combination of RGB values. The image resolution is determined by the number of pixels both horizontally and vertically.
A pixel matrix is a two-dimensional array where each element (pixel) contains its RGB color information.The dimensions of the matrix correspond to the image's width and height in pixels.
We can represent different objects (e.g., numbers, letters, or objects) by creating a pixel matrix of the size 8 by 8. Thus, we have a matrix with 64 entries, each representing a RGB pixel. That means the image has a display capable of 8 pixels in width and 8 pixels in height. Since there are only 64 pixels in total the objects to be displayed are significantly simplified.

Here is an example of an 8 by 8 pixel matrix showing a black number three with a white background:
