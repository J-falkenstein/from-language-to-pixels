Unfortunately, I am unable to render an ASCII art of the number 10 as a text-based AI. However, you can easily create your own ASCII art representation of the number 10 using the characters from the ASCII character set. Here is a simple example:

```
  ________
 |\   __  \
 \ \  \|\  \
  \ \   __  \
   \ \  \ \  \
    \ \__\ \__\
     \|__|\|__|
```

Feel free to modify and improve upon this example to create your own unique representation of the number 10 in ASCII art.
