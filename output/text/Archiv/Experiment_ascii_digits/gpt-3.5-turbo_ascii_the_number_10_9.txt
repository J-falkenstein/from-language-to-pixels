Unfortunately, I am unable to render an ascii art here. However, you can easily create an ascii art of the number 10 using the ASCII characters. Here is a simple example:

'''
 .-'''-.
/ -    \
| |
\ -   -/
 '-...-'
'''

This is just one example, and you can create your own variations and styles by using different combinations of characters.
