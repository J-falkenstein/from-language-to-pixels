I'm sorry, but I cannot provide visual outputs as an AI text-based model. However, you can create your own ASCII art of the number 32 by arranging characters from the ASCII character set in a specific pattern and sequence. Here is a simple example:

'''
  __  
 / _\ 
 \ \  
 _\ \ 
 \__/
'''

Feel free to get creative and experiment with different arrangements and characters to create your desired ASCII art representation of the number 32!
