Here is an example ascii art that forms an image of the letter W:

```
__        __        __        __        __
/  \      /  \      /  \      /  \      /  \
|  |      |  |      |  |  *   |  |      |  |
|  |      |  |      |  | / \  |  |      |  |
|  |  *   |  |  *   |  |/   \|  |  *   |  |
|  | / \  |  | / \  |  |     |  | / \  |  |
|  |/   \|  |/   \|  |     |  |/   \|  |
|  |     |  |     |  |     |  |     |  |
```
