I'm sorry, but it is difficult to render special characters like ß accurately in ASCII art due to the limited character set. However, here is an approximation of the letter ß:

```
  ____  
 / ___| 
( (___  
 \___ \ 
  ___) )
 |____/  
```

Please note that ASCII art is a creative expression and may vary in style and accuracy depending on the artist.
