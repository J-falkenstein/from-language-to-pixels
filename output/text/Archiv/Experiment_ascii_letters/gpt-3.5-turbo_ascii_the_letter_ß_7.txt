I'm sorry, but it is difficult to accurately render an ASCII art of the letter ß using plain text. The letter ß is a special character that is not part of the ASCII character set. However, you can create a representation of the letter using similar characters like "B" or "ss". The following is an example using the letter "B":

```
 ____  
|  __ \ 
| |__) |
|  _  / 
| | \ \ 
|_|  \_\
```
