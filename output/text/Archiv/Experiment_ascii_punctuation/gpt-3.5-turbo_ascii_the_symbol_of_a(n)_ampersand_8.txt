Here is an example of an ASCII art representation of an ampersand symbol:

```
   ,--.
  ()   \
      .- \ 
     /   |\ 
     \_ / |
        \ \
        / /
     __/__\__
```

This is just one example, and there are many variations and styles that can be used to depict the ampersand symbol in ASCII art.
