Here is an example of ASCII art representing the dollar sign symbol:

```
  $$$$$$\                      
 $$  __$$\                     
 $$ /  \__| $$$$$$\   $$$$$$$\ 
 $$ |       \____$$\ $$  _____|
 $$ |       $$$$$$$ |$$ |      
 $$ |  $$\ $$  __$$ |$$ |      
 \$$$$$$  |\$$$$$$$ |$$ |      
  \______/  \_______|\__|      
```
