Unfortunately, I cannot generate an SVG image directly as I am a text-based conversational AI. However, I can guide you on how to create an SVG image of a chair.

To create an SVG image of a chair, you can use similar techniques as in the previous examples. Here is an example of HTML code for an SVG showing a simplified representation of a chair:

```html
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <!-- Legs -->
  <rect x="-80" y="-80" width="20" height="100" fill="black" />
  <rect x="60" y="-80" width="20" height="100" fill="black" />
  <rect x="-80" y="-80" width="20" height="20" fill="black" />
  <rect x="60" y="-80" width="20" height="20" fill="black" />

  <!-- Seat -->
  <rect x="-70" y="-20" width="140" height="20" fill="gray" />

  <!-- Backrest -->
  <rect x="-70" y="-80" width="20" height="60" fill="gray" />
  <rect x="50" y="-80" width="20" height="60" fill="gray" />
</svg>
```

This code creates a simple representation of a chair with four legs, a horizontal seat, and a vertical backrest. The legs are created using rectangles, the seat is a larger rectangle, and the backrest is composed of two smaller rectangles.

You can adjust the dimensions, colors, and other attributes of the SVG elements according to your preferences to create a more detailed representation of a chair.
