Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly represent a realistic image of coffee using SVG code, as SVG is more suitable for creating geometric shapes and illustrations rather than realistic images. However, you can utilize SVG to create simplified representations of the different elements mentioned in the description of coffee. For example:

<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect x="30" y="30" width="40" height="40" fill="brown" />
  <path d="M70,45 L55,25 L45,65 L70,45 Z" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
  <path d="M15,45 Q30,70 45,45" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
  <path d="M55,25 Q70,5 85,25" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>

This code represents a simplified coffee cup shape, with a brown rectangular base, a curved handle on one side, and two curved lines representing steam rising from the cup.

Please note that this representation is highly simplified and may not accurately reflect the appearance of a real cup of coffee.
