A simplified visual representation of number 0 can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. The fundamental shape of the number 0 is a circle. To emphasize its recognition, the circle should occupy the central 6x6 pixels within the grid. This will give the circle a proportionate appearance within the artwork. The circle should be aligned in the center of the grid, maintaining equal spacing between the edges of the grid and the circle. The spatial relationship of the circle with the grid should create a clear contrast, ensuring that the circle stands out prominently. The artwork should omit intricate details and focus solely on the circle, enabling immediate recognition of the number 0.
