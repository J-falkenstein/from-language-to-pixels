A simplified visual representation of the number 1 for an 8x8 pixel artwork would be a vertical line occupying the center column of the canvas. The line should extend from the top to the bottom of the canvas, with a single pixel width. This simple depiction ensures recognition of the number 1 while keeping it distinct from other numbers. The proportion of the line should be slightly taller than the width of the canvas, maintaining a harmonious relationship between height and width.
