A simplified visual representation of the number 2 for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be achieved by using the following description:

The number 2 can be represented as a slightly curved vertical line, positioned centrally within the frame. The vertical line should span the entire height of the frame, reaching from the top to the bottom. 

Starting at the top of the line, there should be a small horizontal line extending to the right, positioned slightly below the top of the vertical line. The horizontal line should be shorter in length than the vertical line.

At the bottom of the vertical line, there should be another small horizontal line extending to the right, positioned slightly above the bottom of the vertical line. This horizontal line should be longer than the one at the top, and it should extend towards the right edge of the frame. The length of this line should be approximately two-thirds of the vertical line's length.

By following these guidelines, you can create a simplified representation of the number 2 in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
