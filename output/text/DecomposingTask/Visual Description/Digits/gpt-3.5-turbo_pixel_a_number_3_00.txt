A simplified visual representation of the number 3 for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be created as follows:

- The number 3 should be represented as two rectangles placed diagonally to form a "backwards C" shape.
- The rectangles should be vertical and have a width of 2 pixels each.
- The top rectangle should start at the top-left corner of the artwork and extend downwards by 4 pixels.
- The bottom rectangle should start at the bottom-right corner of the artwork and extend upwards by 4 pixels.
- The diagonally placed rectangles should be evenly aligned with a small gap between them.
- The gap between the rectangles should be 1 pixel wide and placed at the center of the artwork.
- The remaining pixels in the artwork can be left blank (white) to maintain simplicity.

Remember that this simplified representation only captures the essential features of the number 3, omitting intricate details to fit within the space constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
