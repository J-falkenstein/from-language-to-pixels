A simplified visual representation of the number 4 can be achieved in an 8x8 pixel artwork by focusing on the essential features for recognition. The number 4 consists of a vertical line aligned to one side, combined with a horizontal line crossing it at the upper end. 

To create the simplified rendition, draw a single vertical line that covers the leftmost column of the 8x8 grid. Then, draw a horizontal line that starts at the top of the vertical line and extends to the right for approximately two-thirds of the grid's width. Position the horizontal line slightly below the topmost row to allow room for the vertical line's top. This horizontal line should be aligned with the topmost section of the vertical line. 

Next, connect the right end of the horizontal line to the bottom of the vertical line with a diagonal line, forming the base of the number 4. This diagonal line should slope down towards the bottom-right corner of the 8x8 grid. 

Ensure that all lines maintain a consistent thickness of one pixel to maintain simplicity and clarity. Pay attention to align the lines properly and maintain the proportions according to the simplified representation of the essential features of the number 4.
