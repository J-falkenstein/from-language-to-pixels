A simplified visual representation of the number 5 can be created by using straight lines and basic shapes. 

To create an 8x8 pixel artwork of the number 5, start by drawing a vertical line in the center of the canvas, spanning the entire height (8 pixels) from top to bottom. This line represents the main body of the number 5.

Next, draw a horizontal line at the top of the canvas, extending to the right from the upper end of the vertical line. This line should be shorter in length, occupying around 2 or 3 pixels from the left side of the canvas. This horizontal line represents the top arm of the number 5.

Then, draw another horizontal line at the bottom of the canvas, extending to the right from the lower end of the vertical line. Like the top arm, this line should also be shorter, occupying around 2 or 3 pixels from the left side of the canvas. This line represents the bottom arm of the number 5.

Finally, draw a diagonal line starting from the upper end of the vertical line, directed towards the right and slightly downwards. This line should meet the upper arm near its end, forming a slanted connection. This diagonal line represents the slanted part of the number 5.

In this simplified rendition of the number 5, the essential features for recognition include the vertical line, the top and bottom arms, and the diagonal connection. The proportions of the arms may be slightly shorter compared to the height of the vertical line, and the diagonal line should create a recognizable slanted shape.
