A simplified visual representation of the number 6 can be achieved using a rectangular shape divided into three equal parts horizontally. 

First, create an 8x8 pixel canvas. Starting from the top-left corner, draw a rectangle that spans the first two columns and the first two rows of the canvas, representing the top half of the number 6. 

Next, draw a shorter rectangle below the first one, occupying the first two columns and the last two rows of the canvas. This rectangle represents the bottom half of the number 6.

Finally, draw a vertical line connecting the middle of the first rectangle to the middle of the second rectangle. This line divides the number 6 into two distinct parts and helps to create its recognizable shape.

To ensure recognition, ensure that the rectangles are properly aligned and centered within the canvas. The height of the rectangles should be equal, and their widths should be about half their height, leaving an equal amount of space between them and the edges of the canvas.

By following this simplified design, the fundamental shape and distinctive traits of the number 6 can be clearly represented in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
