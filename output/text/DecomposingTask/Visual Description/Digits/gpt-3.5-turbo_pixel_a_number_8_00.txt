A simplified visual representation of the number 8 for an 8x8 pixel artwork could be described as follows:

- The number 8 should be symmetrical and composed of two circles.
- Each circle should be approximately 4 pixels in diameter.
- The circles should be aligned vertically, positioned one above the other.
- The top circle should be slightly larger than the bottom circle.
- The vertical alignment of the circles should be centered within the 8x8 pixel canvas.
- The circles should have a small gap between them, approximately 1 pixel wide.
- The upper circle should be positioned slightly to the right of the lower circle.
- The outer sides of both circles should be smooth and round.
- The inner sides of both circles should have a gentle curve connecting them, forming the 8 shape.
- The top and bottom of the number 8 should be flat, forming horizontal lines.
- The overall shape should be recognizable as the number 8 even with the simplified representation.

Note: Due to the limited detail provided by an 8x8 pixel artwork, some aspects may need to be further simplified or adapted to fit within the available space while maintaining the essential features necessary for number 8 recognition.
