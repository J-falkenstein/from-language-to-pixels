A simplified visual representation of the number 10 for an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of two separate rectangular shapes, one larger and one smaller. 

The larger rectangle would be positioned vertically, spanning the central columns of the artwork. It would have a width of 4 pixels and a height of 8 pixels, covering the entire height of the canvas. This rectangular shape represents the straight vertical line of the number 1 in the digit 10.

The smaller rectangle would be positioned horizontally, aligned with the lower part of the larger rectangle. It would have a width of 8 pixels and a height of 2 pixels. This shape represents the horizontal line of the number 0 in the digit 10.

The two rectangles would be distinct from each other, with clear spacing in between. The vertical rectangle should be aligned centrally within the canvas, ensuring equal columns of empty pixels on either side. The horizontal rectangle would be positioned underneath the vertical rectangle, with a small gap (1 pixel) between them.

This simplified representation focuses on the essential elements of the number 10, highlighting the straight vertical line and the horizontal line. Other intricate details, such as curves or serifs, are omitted due to space constraints.
