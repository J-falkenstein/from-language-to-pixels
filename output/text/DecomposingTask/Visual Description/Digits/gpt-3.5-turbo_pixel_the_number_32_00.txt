A simplified visual representation of the number 32 for an 8x8 pixel artwork would be as follows:

1. Start with a rectangular shape that measures 4 pixels in height and 2 pixels in width.
2. Place the rectangle vertically, aligning the leftmost edge at position (0,0) and the rightmost edge at position (1,3).
3. Divide the rectangle into two equal parts horizontally.
4. The top half of the rectangle should occupy positions (0,0) to (1,1), while the bottom half should occupy positions (0,2) to (1,3).
5. Within the top half, at position (0,0), draw a smaller rectangular shape measuring 1 pixel in height and 2 pixels in width, representing the top part of the number "3".
6. Finally, at position (0,2), draw a diagonal line connecting the top left corner of the bottom half of the rectangle to the bottom right corner. This diagonal line represents the bottom part of the number "2".

By following these steps, you will have a simplified rendition of the number 32 in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
