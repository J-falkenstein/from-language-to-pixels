A simplified visual representation of the number 9 for an 8x8 pixel artwork would comprise of a vertical straight line in the middle, extending from the top to the bottom of the grid. This line should be aligned centrally within the grid. Towards the top left of the grid, a small semicircle should be added, curved towards the right side and partially overlapping with the vertical line. Additionally, a small diagonal line should be incorporated towards the bottom right of the grid, connecting to the vertical line at a slight angle, making the number look like it has a tail. With these features, the number 9 can be recognized in a simplified form, ensuring its legibility within the space constraints.
