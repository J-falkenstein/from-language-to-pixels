A simplified visual representation of the capital letter A for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be described as follows:

The letter A can be represented as an uppercase "V" shape with a horizontal line connecting the two arms of the "V" in the middle. The "V" arms start at the top corners of the artwork and slope diagonally towards the center. The length of each arm should be about 2 pixels. The horizontal line is positioned below the top edge and connects the two "V" arms, spanning 3 pixels. The lower portion of the artwork, below the horizontal line, should be left empty.

Overall, the key features to emphasize are the diagonal "V" arms and the horizontal line connecting them, forming a recognizable representation of the capital letter A within the limited space of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
