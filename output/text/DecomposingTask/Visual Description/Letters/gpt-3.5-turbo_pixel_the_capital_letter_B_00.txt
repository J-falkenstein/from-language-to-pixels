A simplified visual representation of the capital letter B can be created by using a combination of straight lines and curves. Start with a vertical line that is 6 pixels tall and centered in the 8x8 pixel grid. At the top of this line, draw a curved line with a radius of 2 pixels, bending inward from the left side towards the vertical line. Then, draw a slightly arched horizontal line, starting from the end of the curved line towards the right side, and extending 5 pixels. Connect the end of this horizontal line to the bottom of the vertical line using a slightly curved line, forming the base of the letter B. This creates a rounded triangular shape in the upper-left corner and an open loop in the lower-right corner. Ensure that the proportions are maintained, with the curved line at the top being slightly larger than the curved line at the bottom. The overall shape should have a balanced and recognizable appearance, capturing the essence of the capital letter B in a simplified manner.
