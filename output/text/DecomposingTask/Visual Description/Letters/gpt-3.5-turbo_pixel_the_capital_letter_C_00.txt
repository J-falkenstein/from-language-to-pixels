A simplified visual representation of the capital letter C can be created within an 8x8 pixel artwork by emphasizing its essential features. 

Start by drawing a vertical line from the top to the bottom of the canvas, occupying the leftmost and rightmost columns. This line should be centered, approximately two pixels thick. 

Next, create a smooth curve connecting the top and bottom of the vertical line, positioned towards the right side of the canvas. The curve starts slightly below the top of the vertical line and ends slightly above the bottom of the vertical line, forming a semi-circle. Ensure that the curve does not touch the left side of the canvas, leaving one or two pixels of space. 

To complete the representation, draw a short horizontal line, around two to three pixels long, extending from the bottom of the vertical line towards the right side of the canvas. Place it at a slight upward angle, ending approximately one or two pixels below the middle of the semi-circle. 

Overall, this simplified representation of the capital letter C should appear like a vertical line connected to a semi-circle on the right, with a small horizontal line extending from the bottom of the vertical line. The center of the semi-circle should be between the third and fourth columns, while the vertical line and the bottom horizontal line stay aligned with the left and bottom edges of the canvas, respectively.
