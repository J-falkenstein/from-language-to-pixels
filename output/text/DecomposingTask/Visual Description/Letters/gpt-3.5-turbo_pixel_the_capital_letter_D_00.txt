A simplified visual representation of the capital letter D in an 8x8 pixel artwork would have the following features:

- The letter D would be represented using a 5x5 grid, leaving two pixels empty on the top and one pixel empty on the bottom.
- The left vertical stroke of the letter D would be a continuous line covering the entire length of the grid, starting from the top left corner and going down to the bottom left corner.
- The right vertical stroke of the letter D would start from the top right corner and go down to the bottom right corner. It would be slightly curved, resembling a backward "C" shape.
- Where the left and right strokes meet at the bottom, there would be a small semi-circular curve connecting them, forming the open space of the letter D.
- The proportions of the strokes and the curved space would be approximately equal, emphasizing a balanced look.
- The strokes and curves would be at the edges of the grid, limiting the amount of space used and ensuring the distinctive shape is recognizable.
- The strokes and the curved space would be aligned horizontally, maintaining the characteristic orientation of the capital letter D.

In summary, this simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of the capital letter D would focus on the essential features: a continuous left vertical stroke, a slightly curved right vertical stroke, and a small curved space connecting them, all aligned horizontally on the grid.
