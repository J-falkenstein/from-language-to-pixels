The simplified visual representation of the capital letter E would be a vertical rectangle with three horizontal lines intersecting it. The vertical rectangle would occupy the central 4x8 pixels of the artwork, with a width of 2 pixels. The top horizontal line would span the entire width of the rectangle and be positioned at the topmost pixel of the rectangle. The second horizontal line would be positioned in the middle of the rectangle, also spanning its entire width. The bottom horizontal line would be located at the bottommost pixel of the rectangle, extending its entire width. The proportions of the intersecting lines would be such that each line occupies one pixel in height and spans two pixels in width. All lines should be equidistant from each other, with one pixel of space separating each line.
