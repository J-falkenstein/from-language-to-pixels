A simplified visual representation of the capital letter F, suitable for an 8x8 pixel artwork, can be described as follows:

The letter F can be represented by a vertical stem that occupies the leftmost three pixels of the canvas. The stem spans from the top to the bottom of the canvas, creating a strong vertical line. From the top of this stem, two horizontal lines extend to the right, each spanning two pixels in length. The first horizontal line starts at the top of the stem, one pixel below its top edge. The second horizontal line starts two pixels below the top, aligning with the bottom edge of the first horizontal line. These two horizontal lines are parallel to each other and are positioned closer to the bottom edge of the canvas. Finally, the stem slightly overlaps the bottom edge of the second horizontal line, creating a visually balanced composition.

In this simplified rendition, proportions are adjusted to fit within the 8x8 pixel constraint, resulting in a recognizable representation of the capital letter F while omitting intricate details.
