A simplified visual representation of the capital letter G can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. The fundamental shape of the letter G consists of a downward facing loop on the left side, followed by a horizontal bar extending from the loop to the right. 

Starting from the top-left corner of the 8x8 grid, the loop can be represented by a pixel at (1,2) and then a diagonal line connecting to the (2,3) pixel. From there, a vertical line extends downwards, reaching the bottom at (2,7). 

To complete the horizontal bar, a pixel is placed at (3,7) and a connecting line is drawn to the right until (6,7), maintaining a straight alignment. 

These pixels represent the essential features of the capital letter G, capturing its distinctive traits without intricate details. The proportions, alignments, and spatial relationships are simplified and adjusted to fit within the limited 8x8 pixel space.
