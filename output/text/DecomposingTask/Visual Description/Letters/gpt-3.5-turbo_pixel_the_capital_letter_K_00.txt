A simplified visual representation of the capital letter K for an 8x8 pixel artwork focuses on its essential features for easy recognition. 

Start by creating a vertical line of 3 pixels in the leftmost column. This will serve as the left stem of the letter K. 

At the top-right corner of this vertical line, extend a diagonal line that moves towards the bottom-right corner. This diagonal line should span 4 pixels in length and have a downwards slope. This diagonal line represents the upper arm of the letter K. 

Starting from the bottom-right corner of the diagonal line, create a vertical line that extends downwards by 3 pixels. This vertical line represents the right stem of the letter K. 

To complete the distinctive shape of the letter K, draw a diagonal line that connects the bottom of the left stem to the bottom of the right stem. This diagonal line should move from the bottom-left corner to the bottom-right corner, spanning 2 pixels in length. 

Ensure that the upper arm and the diagonal connecting line intersect at a point. This intersection occurs around the middle of the vertical line representing the right stem. 

The simplified visual representation of the capital letter K consists of these essential features: a left stem, an upper arm, a right stem, and a diagonal connecting line. These features should be clear and distinguishable, while omitting intricate details to fit the limited space of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
