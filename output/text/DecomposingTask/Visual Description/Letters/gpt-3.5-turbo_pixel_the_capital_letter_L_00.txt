A simplified visual representation of the capital letter L can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. 

The fundamental shape of the letter L would consist of two vertical lines intersected by a horizontal line. The vertical lines should be equal in length, spanning 6 pixels each, starting from the top-left corner of the grid and extending downwards. 

The horizontal line should be aligned with the bottom ends of the vertical lines, spanning 4 pixels and positioned to the right of the left vertical line. 

To emphasize the distinctive traits of the letter L, you can ensure that the ends of the vertical lines and the horizontal line are formed with a single, solid pixel. These endpoints could be aligned with the grid's corners to maintain symmetry and clarity. 

By following these instructions, you will have a simplified representation of the capital letter L that is recognizable within the constraints of the 8x8 pixel grid.
