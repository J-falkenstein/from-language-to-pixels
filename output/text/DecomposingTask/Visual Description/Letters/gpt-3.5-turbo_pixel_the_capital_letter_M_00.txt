A simplified visual representation of the capital letter M for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be achieved by focusing on its essential features. 

The fundamental shape of the capital letter M consists of two diagonal strokes that intersect at the center, forming a peak in the middle. Each stroke starts from the top-left corner and slopes downward towards the center, then slopes upward to the top-right corner, creating a distinct 'V' shape in the middle. 

To maintain proportion and alignment, the width of each stroke should occupy approximately two pixels. The distance between the two strokes should also be about two pixels, centered horizontally within the 8x8 grid.

In this simplified rendition, it is essential to emphasize the distinct 'V' shape formed by the intersecting strokes, as this is the primary trait that helps recognize the letter M.
