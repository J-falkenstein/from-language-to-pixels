A simplified visual representation of the capital letter Q for an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of the following features:

1. The Q will be a square shape with equal height and width. The dimensions would be 8 pixels by 8 pixels.
2. The top-left corner of the square will be empty or transparent.
3. Starting from the top-right corner, a diagonal line will extend towards the bottom-left corner, occupying the entire left half of the square.
4. The diagonal line will intersect with the bottom edge of the square, creating a rounded curve.
5. From the rounded curve, a vertical line will extend upwards and align with the top-right corner of the square.
6. The vertical line will pass slightly above the center of the square, creating a noticeable gap between the top edge of the square and the line.
7. The diagonal line, rounded curve, and vertical line should all be straight and aligned with the pixel grid.

This simplified representation captures the essential features of the capital letter Q while omitting intricate details due to space constraints.
