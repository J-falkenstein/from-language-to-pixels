A simplified visual representation of the capital letter R for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be described as follows:

- Start with a vertical line that spans from the top to the bottom of the 8x8 grid, positioned towards the left side.
- Approximately one-third of the way down from the top, draw a slightly slanted line that connects to the right side of the vertical line, forming a right-angled bend.
- From the end of the slanted line, draw a curved line towards the bottom-right corner, creating a graceful arc.
- Finally, connect the bottom-right corner to the bottom of the vertical line with a horizontal line, completing the shape.

In this simplified rendition, the emphasis is on the overall form and distinctive traits of the letter R. Intricate details like serifs or extended curves are omitted to fit within the limited space of the 8x8 pixel grid.
