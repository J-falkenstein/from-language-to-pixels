In a simplified visual representation of the capital letter S, we would emphasize the basic shape and distinctive traits for easy recognition within an 8x8 pixel artwork. The essential features would include two diagonal lines intersecting in the center, forming an acute angle at the top and an obtuse angle at the bottom. 

Starting from the top left corner, the first diagonal line would slant downwards and towards the right, occupying approximately two-thirds of the width of the canvas. This line would have a slight curve near the bottom to form the top section of the letter S.

The second diagonal line would start from the top-right corner, slanting downwards and towards the left. It would intersect the first line slightly above its midpoint, forming the center of the letter S. This intersection would create a distinctive curve at the bottom of the letter, which would extend slightly to the left before ending at the bottom right corner of the canvas.

The proportions and alignments would ensure that the curves are recognizable within the limited space. The diagonals should be spaced evenly from the edges of the canvas, and the intersection point should be positioned appropriately. While the simplified rendition may lack intricate details, these essential features should be captured in order to convey the shape and recognition of the capital letter S in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
