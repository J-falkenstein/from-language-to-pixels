A simplified visual representation of the capital letter T for an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of three vertical pixels and two horizontal pixels. 

Starting from the top, the first vertical pixel would be placed at the center of the top row. The second and third vertical pixels would be aligned directly below the first pixel. 

For the horizontal part of the T, the first pixel would be placed in the center of the leftmost column. The second pixel would be placed directly to the right of the first pixel, also in the center. 

This simplified T shape would have a total of five pixels, with three vertical pixels and two horizontal pixels. The vertical line of the T would be longer, occupying three pixels, while the horizontal line would be shorter, occupying two pixels.
