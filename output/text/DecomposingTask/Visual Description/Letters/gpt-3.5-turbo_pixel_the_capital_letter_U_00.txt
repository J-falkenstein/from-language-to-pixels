The simplified visual representation of the capital letter U for an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a vertical line on the left side of the canvas, followed by a horizontal line connecting the top end of the vertical line to the right side of the canvas, and finally, a diagonal line connecting the bottom end of the vertical line to the right side of the canvas. 

The vertical line should occupy 2 pixels in width and should extend from the top of the canvas to the 6th row. The horizontal line should also be 2 pixels wide and should start from the top of the canvas in the 3rd row, extending till the 6th column. Lastly, the diagonal line should be 3 pixels wide and should start from the bottom of the vertical line, extending towards the right side of the canvas until the 5th row.

By following this simplified representation, the capital letter U can be recognized with its distinct curved shape formed by the connections between the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines within the limited 8x8 pixel space.
