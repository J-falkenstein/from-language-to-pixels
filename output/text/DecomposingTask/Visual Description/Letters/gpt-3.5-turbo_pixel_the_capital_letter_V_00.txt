A simplified visual representation of the capital letter V for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be rendered as follows:

- The V will consist of two diagonal lines forming an inverted "V" shape.
- Each diagonal line will be three pixels in length.
- The top-left pixel will be the starting point of the first diagonal line, while the bottom-right pixel will be the ending point of the second diagonal line.
- The first diagonal line will slope downward from the top-left to the center-left, while the second diagonal line will slope upward from the center-right to the bottom-right.
- The gap between the two diagonal lines will be one pixel, placed at the center of the artwork.

Overall, the artwork will resemble an angular, simple V shape with equal vertical and horizontal proportions. It will emphasize the two diagonal lines forming an inverted V while disregarding finer details.
