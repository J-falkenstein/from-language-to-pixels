A simplified visual representation of the capital letter W for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be achieved by focusing on the essential features for recognition while omitting intricate details. 

The capital letter W is composed of two diagonal lines that start from the bottom corners and meet in the middle. Each diagonal line slants upwards at a 45-degree angle. These lines are parallel and equidistant from each other, but not straight. They are slightly curved, creating a smooth and flowing shape.

To represent the capital letter W in an 8x8 pixel artwork, each diagonal line can be approximated by four or five pixels. The top pixel of each line will be in the middle row, while the bottom pixel will be in the bottom row. The remaining pixels in between should be spaced evenly, but can be slightly curved to maintain the overall shape.

To ensure recognition and maintain proportions, the distance between the diagonal lines should be a little less than half the letter's overall height. This will create a distinct "V" shape at the bottom center of the letter.

By following these guidelines, a simplified rendition of the capital letter W can be created, capturing its fundamental shape and distinctive traits in a concise manner within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
