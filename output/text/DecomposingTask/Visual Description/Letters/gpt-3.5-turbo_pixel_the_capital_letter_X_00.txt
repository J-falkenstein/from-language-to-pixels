A simplified visual representation of the capital letter X can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. Here is a concise description of its fundamental shape and distinctive traits:

1. Start by drawing a vertical line from the top to the bottom of the grid, centered horizontally.
2. On the left side of the vertical line, draw a diagonal line that starts from the top-left corner and ends at the bottom-right corner of the grid.
3. On the right side of the vertical line, draw a diagonal line that starts from the top-right corner and ends at the bottom-left corner of the grid.
4. Ensure that both diagonal lines intersect at the center of the vertical line.
5. The thickness of the vertical and diagonal lines should be equal, consisting of a single pixel.

The simplified rendition of the capital letter X in this 8x8 pixel artwork should emphasize the vertical and diagonal lines' intersections, representing the distinct X shape.
