A simplified visual representation of the capital letter Z for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be described as follows:

The capital letter Z can be depicted as a diagonal line running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the 8x8 pixel canvas. The diagonal line should be thick enough to be visible but not too thick to occupy too many pixels. It should take up approximately two-thirds of the available vertical space in the canvas.

Starting from the top left corner, the diagonal line should extend towards the bottom right corner, passing through the center of the canvas. The line should be straight and sharply angled around the midpoint. The bottom right corner of the Z should align with the bottom right corner of the canvas.

To further emphasize the recognition of the letter, two small lines should be added at the bottom left and top right corners of the canvas, diagonally opposite to each other. These lines should be short, extending only one or two pixels, and positioned slightly away from the diagonal line.

Overall, this simplified representation captures the essential features of the letter Z, including the diagonal line and the additional lines at the corners, while taking into account the limited space available in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
