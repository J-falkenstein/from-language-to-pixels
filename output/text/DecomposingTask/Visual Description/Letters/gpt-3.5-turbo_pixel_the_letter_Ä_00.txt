A simplified visual representation of the letter Ä in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a symmetrical arrangement of pixels. 

Starting from the top-left corner, the first row would have a pixel at the second column, followed by a pixel at the fourth column. The second row would have a pixel at the third column, and the third row would also have a pixel at the third column.

The fourth row would have a pixel at the second column, followed by a pixel at the fourth column. The fifth row would have a pixel at the third column, and the sixth row would also have a pixel at the third column.

The seventh row would have a pixel at the fifth column, and the eighth row would have a pixel at the sixth column.

This simplified representation of the letter Ä captures the essential features for recognition. The distinctive traits include a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right, crossing the center, and a horizontal line in the middle. The proportions, alignments, and spatial relationships are maintained to ensure the recognizability of the letter Ä within the 8x8 pixel artwork.
