To create a simplified visual representation of the letter Ü in an 8x8 pixel artwork, consider the following concise description:

1. Start by drawing a vertical line in the center column of the canvas, occupying three pixels in height.
2. At the top of the vertical line, draw a horizontal line extending three pixels to the left, emphasizing the curve at the end of the line to represent the left side of the Ü.
3. At the bottom of the vertical line, draw another horizontal line extending three pixels to the right, emphasizing the curve at the end of the line to represent the right side of the Ü.
4. Ensure that the top and bottom horizontal lines are aligned horizontally with the central column of the canvas.
5. Between the top and bottom lines, leave one empty pixel in the central column, creating a slight gap in the middle of the Ü.
6. Maintain a balanced and symmetrical appearance overall, with equal proportions of the vertical line, horizontal lines, and the gap.
