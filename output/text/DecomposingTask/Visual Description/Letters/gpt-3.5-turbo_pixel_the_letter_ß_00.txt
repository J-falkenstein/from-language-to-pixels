A simplified visual representation of the letter "ß" can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. 

The fundamental shape of "ß" consists of two parts: a round shape on the top left and a slightly elongated shape on the bottom right. 

Starting from the top left corner of the grid, the first row can contain a single pixel representing the rounded part of the letter. 

In the second row, place three pixels adjacent to each other horizontally, representing the curved shape continuing from the first row. 

The third row can have a single pixel, slightly shifted to the right, representing the connecting point between the rounded and elongated parts of the letter. 

The fourth row can contain five pixels placed horizontally, representing the elongated part of the letter. 

In the fifth row, place three pixels adjacent to each other horizontally, continuing the elongated shape. 

The sixth row can also have a single pixel, slightly shifted to the right, representing the connecting point between the elongated part and the bottom-right curve. 

Finally, the seventh and eighth rows can be left empty to emphasize the distinctive shape of the letter "ß". 

This simplified representation focuses on capturing the essential features of "ß" for recognition, omitting any intricate details due to the limited space of an 8x8 pixel grid.
