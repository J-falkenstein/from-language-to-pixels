The digit 0 has a circular shape, similar to a small and solid O. The most important feature is its roundness. Start by drawing a perfect circle, providing a solid foundation for the digit. Ensure the circle is evenly shaped with no bumps or irregularities. Place the circle in the center of your drawing space, allowing equal spacing around it. The size of the circle should be relatively large compared to other digits. The circular shape should be complete with no gaps or openings within it. By focusing on creating a well-defined circle, you will capture the essence of the number 0.
