The number 0 is a circular shape that has no lines or angles inside it. Imagine a complete, unbroken loop that connects at the top and bottom. The loop should be evenly round and symmetrical, which means the top and bottom connections should be aligned horizontally. Picture a smooth, closed circle with no breaks or openings. Remember, there are no lines or crossing points inside the circle. Focus on creating a perfect, empty loop that represents the number zero.
