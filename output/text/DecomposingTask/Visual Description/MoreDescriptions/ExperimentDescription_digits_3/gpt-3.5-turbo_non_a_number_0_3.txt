The digit "0" is a circular shape. Imagine drawing a very round loop, like a perfect circle. It has no angles or corners. The circular shape is the most important feature of this digit. The diameter of the circle should be slightly smaller compared to the height of other digits, like "1" or "2". It's essential to make sure the circular loop is complete with no gaps or openings. This helps distinguish it from the letter "O" which might have a gap. Remember, a smooth and enclosed circular shape is the key to drawing the number "0".
