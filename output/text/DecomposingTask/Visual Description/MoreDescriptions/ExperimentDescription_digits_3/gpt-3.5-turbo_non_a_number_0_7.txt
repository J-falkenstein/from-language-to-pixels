The number 0 can be visualized as a circular shape. The important feature is its complete enclosed loop, resembling a perfect circle. The circular shape of the zero has no distinct angles or corners. The loop should be evenly rounded without any irregularities or bumps. The size of the zero can vary, but it should be relatively compact, not excessively large or small. It does not have any alignments with other elements or spatial relationships, as it is a standalone digit.
