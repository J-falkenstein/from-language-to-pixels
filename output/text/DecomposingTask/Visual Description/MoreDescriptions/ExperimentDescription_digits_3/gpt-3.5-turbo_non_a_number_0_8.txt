The digit 0 is a perfect circle. It has no corners or angles. Its fundamental shape is round and symmetrical. The circle should fill most of the drawing space. The important feature of the digit 0 is its complete absence of any openings or lines inside the circle. Ensure that the circle is continuous and not broken. The proportions of the circle should be even, with no bulging or distortion. All points on the circle's circumference should be equidistant from the center. Remember to make the circle nice and smooth for a clear representation of the digit 0.
