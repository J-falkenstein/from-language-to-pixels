The number 0 is represented by a circle. Imagine drawing a perfectly round shape, like a O, with no starting or ending point. The edges of the circle should be smooth and well-defined. The loop of the 0 should be evenly curved and slightly thick. Make sure there are no corners or angles on the circle. The size of the circle should be similar to other digits, not too big or too small.
