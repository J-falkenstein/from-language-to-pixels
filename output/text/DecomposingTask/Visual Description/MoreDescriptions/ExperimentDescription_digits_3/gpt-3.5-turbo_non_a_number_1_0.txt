The number 1 can be drawn as a straight vertical line from top to bottom. It is important to ensure that the line is straight and upright. The length of the line should be relatively longer compared to the width. To maintain proportion, the width can be about one-third or one-fourth of the length. The line starts at the top and extends all the way down to the bottom. There are no curves or bends in this digit. It is a solitary vertical line, not connected to any other shapes or lines.
