To draw a simplified version of the number 1, imagine a vertical line standing tall. This line should be longer than any other lines you might draw. The top of the line should start at the very top of the drawing area, and the bottom should extend all the way to the bottom of the drawing area. Keep the line straight and centered. Remember, the key is to have a long, straight vertical line that represents the number 1.
