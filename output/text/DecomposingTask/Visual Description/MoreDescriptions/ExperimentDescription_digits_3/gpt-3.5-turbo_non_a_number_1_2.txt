To draw a simplified version of the number 1, imagine a vertical stick standing tall. It is a straight line from top to bottom, like a long ruler without any curves or bends. The line should be placed in the center of your drawing space. It starts at the top and reaches all the way down to the bottom. Make sure it extends equally above and below the center point, creating a sense of balance. Remember, no loops or hooks, just a simple, perfectly straight line.
