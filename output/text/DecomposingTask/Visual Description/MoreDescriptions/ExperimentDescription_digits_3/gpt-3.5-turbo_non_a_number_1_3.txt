To draw a simplified version of the digit 1, envision a vertical line standing straight and tall like a flagpole. This line should start from the top and extend all the way down to the bottom. Imagine it as a solitary pillar, not leaning or slanting in any direction. It is important to keep the line centered, ensuring it doesn't lean towards the left or right.

The most crucial feature of the number 1 is its single vertical line. No other lines or curves are needed to recognize it. This line represents the essence of the digit.

Remember to maintain the same thickness throughout the entire line, avoiding any variations or tapering towards the edges. Additionally, make sure that the line is not excessively long, extending beyond the typical height of other digits.

By focusing on these fundamental characteristics, you can convey the shape of a simplified digit 1 to a blind person, allowing them to draw it accurately.
