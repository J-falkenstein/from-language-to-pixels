The number 1 can be described as a vertical line. It starts at the top and goes straight down to the bottom, without any curves or angles. It stands tall and upright. Make sure the line is straight and not leaning to either side. The length of the line can vary depending on the desired proportion, but it should be longer than any other lines you may draw for other digits. The number 1 is unique because it doesn't have any other distinctive features or attachments. It's a simple and solitary vertical stroke.
