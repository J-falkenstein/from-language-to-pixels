The number 1 can be described as a vertical line standing straight. It is similar to an upright stick with no curves or angles. The line starts at the top and goes straight down to the bottom. It should be positioned in the center of the paper, parallel to the vertical edges. The length of the line should be long enough to occupy a significant portion of the vertical space, but not too long that it reaches the very bottom. The key point is that it is a single, uninterrupted straight line, representing the number 1.
