The number 1 can be described as a vertical line. It is a simple and straight shape that stands upright. Start at the top and draw a long straight line downwards, ending at the bottom. The line should be centered so that it extends from the top to the bottom of your drawing space, without any curves or bends. It should be the only element on your paper, having enough space on either side to clearly distinguish it from other digits.
