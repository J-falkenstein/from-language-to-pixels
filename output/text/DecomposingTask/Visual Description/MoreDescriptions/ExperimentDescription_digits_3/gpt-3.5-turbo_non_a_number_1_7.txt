To draw a simplified version of the number 1, imagine a vertical stick or stem. It stands alone, unconnected to any other element. The stem is straight and extends from the top to the bottom of the drawing area. Its length should be roughly three to four times its width. That's it! Remember, the key is to have a single vertical line that represents the number 1.
