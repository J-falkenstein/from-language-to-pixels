To draw a simplified version of the digit "1" for a blind person, imagine a vertical line standing tall in the center of a blank canvas. This line should be straight and extend from the top to the bottom of the canvas. Imagine the line slightly thinner towards the top and gradually thickening as it reaches the bottom.

Ensure that the top of the line is aligned with the upper edge of the canvas, while the bottom of the line aligns with the lower edge. This will create a sense of proportion and balance.

Remember, the distinguishing feature of the digit "1" is its singular vertical line. This line should be the main focus and occupy the majority of the canvas. Keep the description simple and precise, emphasizing the straightness and vertical orientation of the line.
