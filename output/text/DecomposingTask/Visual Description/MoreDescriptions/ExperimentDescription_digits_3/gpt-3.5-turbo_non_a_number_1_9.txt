To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 1, you can describe its visual characteristics as follows:

The digit 1 has a fundamental shape of a vertical line. Imagine a straight, upward line that stands tall like a flagpole. It is a single line that goes from top to bottom with no curves or angles.

Ensure the blind person understands that the line should start at the top and extend downwards to the bottom of the drawing space.

The important features of the digit 1 are its tallness and simplicity. Emphasize that the line should be long enough to be noticeable but not too long to become disproportionate. It should be neither too short nor diagonal.

When explaining proportions, mention that the height of the line should be roughly equal to the width of other elements that might be drawn nearby, such as other digits or objects in the scene.

It's important to note that the digit 1 is a stand-alone number and does not align or intersect with any other elements. It stands independently, like a solitary pillar.

Overall, guide the blind person to focus on creating a vertical line that encapsulates the essence of a number 1 while keeping the simplicity and proportionate height in mind.
