The number 2 has a basic shape similar to a curved letter "S" or an elongated lowercase "z." It starts with a slightly slanted vertical line on the left side, towards the top. From there, it curves smoothly towards the right, forming a rounded arc that slopes upwards. The arc reaches its highest point halfway towards the right top corner of the shape. 

The distinctive features of the number 2 are its curved lines and the high point in the middle. The left side of the vertical line and the curve on the right are the defining characteristics. 

To draw a simplified version of number 2, start with a slightly slanted vertical line on the left side, then smoothly curve it towards the right, making sure to reach a high point in the middle.
