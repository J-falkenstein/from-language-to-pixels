Number 2 is a slender and curved digit. Starting from the top, imagine a slightly slanted and elongated "S" shape that is not fully closed. It begins with a short horizontal line, curving gently downwards towards the right, mimicking a lowercase "f." Then, continuing the curve, it loops back slightly upwards to the left to create a small hump that is less pronounced than the first curve. The bottom of the "S" is left open, not joining back to the top. The curves of the number 2 should be smooth and flowing, without any sharp corners. The overall shape of the number 2 can be compared to a graceful swan, with the small hump representing its neck and head. Remember, simplicity is key, so avoid adding unnecessary details that may confuse the blind person.
