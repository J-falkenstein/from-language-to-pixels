The number 2 has a curved shape resembling a lowercase letter "s". Starting from the top left, it curves downwards to the right, then gently turns upwards to create a small loop at the top. This loop is often described as an arch or a hump. The bottom part of the 2 extends downward in a slightly curved line, parallel to the upper part, but shorter in length. It typically ends with a small horizontal line that connects the two curves. The upper curve is larger than the lower one and appears more rounded, while the lower curve is smaller and less pronounced. The two curves are connected smoothly without any sharp angles. The loop at the top is usually positioned slightly towards the right side of the digit, maintaining a central alignment. Remember, these instructions are simplified and do not include specific measurements or proportions.
