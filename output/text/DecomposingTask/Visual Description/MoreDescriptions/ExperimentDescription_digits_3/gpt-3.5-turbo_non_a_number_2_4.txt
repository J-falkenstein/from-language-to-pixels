To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the digit 2, here is a visual description:

The digit 2 has a basic shape resembling a slightly slanted backward letter "C" or a rounded corner rectangle. It starts with a vertical line descending downwards from the top, curving smoothly to the right halfway down. At the bottom right of this curve, it arcs towards the left, forming another smaller curve that merges back into the vertical line, giving the digit a loop-like structure.

The distinctive features of the digit 2 include the downward-sloping vertical line, the smooth curve that flows towards the right, and the smaller curve that connects back into the vertical line. It is important to note that the curves in the digit are not sharp but rather rounded.

The proportions and alignments of the digit 2 can be described as follows: The vertical line begins at the top and extends about two-thirds the height of the digit. The smooth curve that starts from the top-right side flows towards the right, crossing the vertical line at about one-third of its height. Finally, the smaller curve aligns with the lower section of the vertical line, connecting back into it.

To summarize, the digit 2 has a rounded, slightly slanted "C" or rounded corner rectangle shape with a vertical line descending downwards, a smooth rightward curve, and a smaller curve that connects back into the vertical line.
