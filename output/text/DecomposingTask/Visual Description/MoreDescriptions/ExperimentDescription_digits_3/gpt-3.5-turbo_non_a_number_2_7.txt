To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the digit 2, here is a description of its fundamental shape and distinctive features:

1. Start by drawing a slightly curved horizontal line that slightly slopes upwards from left to right.
2. From the right endpoint of the first line, draw a curved vertical line that extends downwards, curving slightly to the right.
3. At the bottom of the vertical line, draw a small, horizontal line that extends towards the left.
4. Above the small horizontal line, draw a slightly curved vertical line that moves upwards and slightly to the left, reaching almost the same height as the top of the first curved line.
5. Finally, connect the top endpoint of the second vertical line to the beginning of the first curved line using a small curved line, creating a loop-shaped structure.

Key points:
- The digit 2 has a curved horizontal line starting from left to right.
- It includes a curved vertical line extending downwards and curving slightly to the right.
- There is a small horizontal line at the bottom, going towards the left.
- Above the small horizontal line, a slightly curved vertical line moves upwards and slightly to the left.
- The top endpoint of the second vertical line connects to the beginning of the first curved line with a small curved line, creating a loop-like shape.

Remember, these instructions are aimed at helping a blind person create a simplified representation of the digit, focusing on its essential features for recognition rather than intricate details.
