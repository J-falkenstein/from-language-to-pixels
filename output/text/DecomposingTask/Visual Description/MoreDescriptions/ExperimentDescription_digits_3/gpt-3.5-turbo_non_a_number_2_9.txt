To describe the shape of the digit 2 visually, you can mention the following key features:

1. Start by drawing a vertical line that goes from top to bottom.
2. At the top of this line, draw a slightly curved line bending towards the right.
3. Around halfway down the vertical line, draw another slightly curved line bending towards the left.
4. Connect the ends of the two curved lines with a small horizontal line, slightly below the midpoint of the vertical line.
5. Just below the small horizontal line, draw a small curved line bending towards the right.
6. Finally, draw a straight line starting at the end of the small curved line and extending downwards, parallel to the initial vertical line, until reaching the bottom.

By following these steps, you will provide the blind person with a simplified representation of the digit 2, capturing its essential characteristics without unnecessary details.
