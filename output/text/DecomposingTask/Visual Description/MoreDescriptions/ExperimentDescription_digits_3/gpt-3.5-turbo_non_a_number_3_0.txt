To describe the shape of the number 3 to a blind person, you can say:

"The digit 3 has a round and curvy shape resembling a backward letter 'C.' It starts with a small rounded loop at the top, curving downwards towards the left. It then continues downward with a long, vertical line that slightly curves outward near the end, mirroring the top loop. The bottom part of the digit extends slightly beyond the top loop and is parallel to it. The top and bottom loops are at a similar height, creating a balanced appearance. Overall, the number 3 has a distinct rounded top loop, a long descending vertical line, and a smaller bottom loop, with the curves forming its most prominent features."
