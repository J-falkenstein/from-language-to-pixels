The number 3 has a round and curved shape, similar to a backward letter "C." Start by drawing a small circle or oval shape, positioned towards the top-left corner of your paper. From the bottom of this circular shape, draw a long, smooth curve that moves downward and slightly to the right, like a stretched out letter "J." This curve should slope gently and end just above the center of the circular shape. 

Next, draw a smaller curve that starts from the bottom of the circular shape, moves downward, and then curves sharply towards the left. It should resemble a "C" shape, but with an open end. This curve will intersect with the first long curve near the bottom part, creating a distinct "tail" or loop. The top part of the "tail" should align with the top curve of the circular shape.

Remember to keep the proportions balanced by ensuring that the circular shape is larger in size compared to the rest of the digit. The loops and curves should be smooth and flowing, but do not worry about intricate details. The main focus is on capturing the overall rounded shape, long downward curve, and the distinctive looped tail.
