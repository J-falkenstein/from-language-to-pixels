To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the number 3, here is a description of its visual characteristics:

The digit 3 has a shape similar to a lowercase letter "e" or a curved backward "C". It consists of two main parts: a rounded loop at the top and a vertical tail at the bottom. 

The rounded loop starts slightly above the midpoint and curves counterclockwise in a smooth manner, forming a semi-circle shape. It should be placed towards the left side of the paper, leaving some space for the tail on the right.

The vertical tail descends downwards from the right side of the loop. It is a relatively straight line that extends below the baseline of the digit. The tail ends with a slight curve at the bottom, creating a small hook-like feature.

Ensure that the loop is larger than the tail, making it more prominent. The loop should be positioned above the tail, slightly overlapping it at the top. The overall height of the digit should be around twice the length of the tail.

Remember, simplicity is key when focusing on the most important features. Encourage the blind person to practice drawing these simplified elements until they can represent the essence of a number 3.
