To create a simplified version of the digit "3" for a blind person, imagine an arched shape similar to a half-circle standing upright. Here's a concise description of its visual characteristics:

The digit "3" can be represented as an upright half-circle shape. Starting from the top, draw a smooth curve that gently arcs downward to form an almost semi-circular shape, but not completely closed. Towards the bottom, extend a small sideways loop extending outward, resembling an open hook. This loop should align roughly with the midpoint of the half-circle. Remember to ensure that the loop is smaller in size compared to the upper half-circle. This distinction between the upper round shape and the smaller loop is what makes the digit "3" recognizable.
