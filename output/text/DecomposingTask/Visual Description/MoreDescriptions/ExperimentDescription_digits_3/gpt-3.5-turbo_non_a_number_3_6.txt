The digit 3 can be represented as a curved shape resembling a backwards letter "C" with a small, downward-facing protrusion on the right side. The main body of the digit is a smooth curve that starts at the top and gradually slopes downward to the left. It then forms a rounded bend at the bottom and curves upwards to the right, ending with a small extension that points downwards.

To illustrate the proportions, imagine that the top of the digit is slightly smaller than the bottom. The height of the curved body is approximately two-thirds of the total height of the digit. The downward-facing protrusion on the right is relatively small compared to the overall size of the digit.

The alignment of the digit can be described as vertical with a slight tilt to the left. The top of the digit starts at the upper left corner and descends diagonally towards the lower right corner. The bottom of the digit aligns with the lower left corner and slightly slopes upwards towards the right.

It's important to note that the above description aims to provide a simplified representation of the digit 3, focusing on its key features for recognition.
