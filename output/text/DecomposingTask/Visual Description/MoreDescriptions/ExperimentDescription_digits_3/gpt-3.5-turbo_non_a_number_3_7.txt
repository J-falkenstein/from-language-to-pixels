To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the number 3, I would describe its key visual characteristics as follows:

1. Start by drawing a slightly slanted oval shape, leaning to the right.
2. At the top right corner of the oval, draw a small, curved line that gently arcs downwards and to the left.
3. Continuing from the end of the previous line, draw a long, vertical line downwards, parallel to the right side of the oval.
4. About halfway down the vertical line, draw a small, rounded loop or arc that curves towards the right side of the oval.
5. Finally, let the curved line merge smoothly into the bottom right side of the oval, completing the number 3.

Remember to emphasize the slanted oval shape, the curved line at the top, the vertical line, the loop, and the successful merge with the oval. These distinctive features should be enough for someone to recognize and draw a simplified version of the number 3 without unnecessary details.
