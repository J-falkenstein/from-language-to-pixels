The number 3 has a curved shape that resembles a backward letter C. Start at the top left and move diagonally downwards and to the right to create a smooth curve. Then, continue the curve around to the left to form a rounded loop that opens towards the top left. The loop should be smaller in size compared to the initial curve. The curve and loop of the 3 should be connected smoothly without any breaks or angles. This creates a distinct and recognizable shape for the number 3.
