To draw a simplified version of the number 4, imagine an upright stick figure with a small loop attached at the top-right corner. 

Begin by drawing a vertical straight line from top to bottom. This line represents the main body of the number 4. It should be a bit taller than it is wide. 

Next, near the top-right corner of the vertical line, imagine a small circle or loop attached. This loop should be rounded and open towards the left side. It will form the top part of the number 4, resembling a small umbrella handle. 

That's it! You have successfully described the essential features of the number 4. Remember, this simplified version removes unnecessary details, focusing on the distinctive loop at the top-right corner of the vertical line.
