To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the digit 4, here is a clear and concise description:

The digit 4 has a vertical line on the left side as its fundamental shape. This line stretches from the top of the space to a little below the middle. At the top end of this vertical line, there is a small horizontal line extending towards the right. This line is positioned around the middle of the vertical line.

Together, these two lines create the distinctive features of the digit 4. Imagine the vertical line as the main body, and the horizontal line as a little arm extending to the right from the top part of the body.

For proportions, the vertical line should be longer than the horizontal line to maintain proper recognition. It can be around two-thirds of the total height, while the horizontal line should be approximately one-third the length of the vertical line.

To maintain spatial relationships, position the horizontal line towards the top-right side of the vertical line, ensuring that the top ends align. The horizontal line should stay connected to the vertical line, creating a right angle at the junction.

With these instructions, a simplified version of the digit 4 can be drawn, emphasizing its essential features without worrying about intricate details.
