To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the digit 4, I would describe its fundamental shape and distinctive features. Here's how I would describe it:

The digit 4 has a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line on top, forming a right-angled corner at the upper left. The vertical line starts at the top and extends straight down, ending a short distance above the bottom edge. It is slightly curved, resembling the shape of a flagpole. 

The horizontal line begins at the right end of the upper part of the vertical line, extending towards the right. It is shorter than the vertical line, touching it at a right angle. This horizontal line is positioned slightly below the halfway point of the vertical line, creating a sense of balance.

By focusing on these key features, the blind person can depict the digit 4 with its characteristic shape and recognizable elements.
