To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the digit "4," I would describe its fundamental shape and distinctive features as follows:

1. Start by drawing a vertical line down from the top of the paper.
2. Then, approximately one-third of the way down the vertical line, draw a short horizontal line extending to the right.
3. From the end of the horizontal line, curve it gently downwards towards the right, creating a small hook-like shape.
4. Once the hook shape is complete, extend the line downwards in a straight vertical manner, almost parallel to the initial vertical line.
5. Finally, at the bottom of the vertical line, slightly curve it towards the left, forming a small rounded loop.

To summarize, the digit "4" can be drawn by starting with a vertical line, adding a short horizontal line one-third down, curving it downwards to the right, extending the line downwards, and finishing with a small rounded loop at the bottom.
