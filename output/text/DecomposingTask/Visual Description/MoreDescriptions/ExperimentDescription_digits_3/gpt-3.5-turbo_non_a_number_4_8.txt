To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the digit 4, I would describe its shape and distinctive features as follows:

The digit 4 has a vertical line on the left side that extends from the top to the bottom of the space. This line should be straight and positioned slightly towards the left side. 

From the top of the vertical line, move towards the right at a slight angle. Then create a horizontal line that connects with the vertical line, creating a right-angled corner. This horizontal line should be shorter than the vertical line, extending around halfway across the space.

From the right end of the horizontal line, draw a diagonal line moving downwards towards the right. This line should be slanted at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and should meet the bottom of the vertical line, forming another right-angled corner. 

Lastly, describe a short horizontal line that connects the bottom of the vertical line and the end of the diagonal line. This line should be parallel to the horizontal line above it, completing the digit 4.

Remember to emphasize the straight vertical line on the left, the shorter horizontal line, the angled diagonal line, and the final connecting short horizontal line. These key components should be sufficient for someone to understand and draw a simplified version of the digit 4.
