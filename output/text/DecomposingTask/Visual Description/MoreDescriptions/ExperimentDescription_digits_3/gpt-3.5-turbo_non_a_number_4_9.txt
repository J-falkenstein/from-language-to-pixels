To describe the visual characteristics of the number 4 to a blind person, you would say:

"The digit 4 has a basic shape of a vertical straight line on the left side, going from the top to the bottom. At the top of this line, there is a horizontal line extending towards the right. This horizontal line is shorter in length compared to the vertical line, and it starts slightly below the top of the vertical line. The bottom end of the vertical line extends further down, finishing with a small curve or hook towards the right. This small curve is important to distinguish it from the straight vertical line of the digit 1. The alignment is such that the horizontal line intersects the vertical line slightly below its midpoint. This creates an open space between the horizontal line and the bottom curve, giving the digit 4 its characteristic appearance."

Note: It may be helpful to utilize tactile aids or refer to a raised-line drawing or embossed representation of the digit for better comprehension.
