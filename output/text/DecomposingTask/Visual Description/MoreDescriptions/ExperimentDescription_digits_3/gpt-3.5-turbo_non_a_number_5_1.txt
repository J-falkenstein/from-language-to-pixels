To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the digit 5, here is a description of its fundamental shape, distinctive features, proportions, alignments, and spatial relationships:

Start by imagining a straight vertical line from top to bottom, representing the central spine of the digit. Towards the top of the line, around one-third of the way down, imagine a small horizontal line extending towards the right. This horizontal line should be shorter than the vertical spine and positioned diagonally, slanting slightly upwards.

At the end of this slanted line, imagine a rounded curve that smoothly connects back to the vertical spine, forming a closed loop. The top of this curved loop should be at a similar height as the top of the slanted line, while the bottom of the loop should align with the bottom of the vertical spine.

Continuing from the bottom of the vertical spine, imagine a short horizontal line extending towards the right, positioned around two-thirds of the way down. This line should be parallel to the top slanted line but shorter in length.

Towards the right of the digit, slightly below the loop, imagine another short horizontal line that runs parallel to the previous two lines. This line should be positioned at a similar height as the bottom horizontal line.

Lastly, imagine a small curved tail projecting downwards from the end of the bottom horizontal line, curving slightly towards the left. This tail should be shorter than the other lines and aligned with the bottom horizontal line.

Overall, the digit 5 consists of a vertical spine, a slanted line towards the top right, a closed loop connecting back to the spine, two shorter horizontal lines towards the right, and a small curved tail at the bottom.
