The digit 5 can be represented as an elongated, curved shape. Start by drawing a slightly inclined vertical line from the top to the bottom. At the top end, create a small curved hook pointing towards the right. This hook should be positioned towards the right side of the top of the vertical line. 

Next, draw a diagonal line starting from the top left side of the vertical line and sloping downwards towards the right. This line should intersect the vertical line approximately halfway down. 

Completing the digit, add a horizontal line connecting the rightmost points of the diagonal line and the curved hook. This line should be positioned a bit above the bottom of the vertical line. 

Remember, it is important to emphasize the overall curved shape of the digit and the distinct diagonal line that intersects the vertical line. Through these guiding features, you can successfully depict the simplified version of the number 5.
