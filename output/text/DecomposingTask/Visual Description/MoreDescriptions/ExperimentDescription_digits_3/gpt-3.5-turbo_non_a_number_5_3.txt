The number 5 has a curvy shape resembling a lowercase "s" tipped on its side. Its fundamental shape is similar to a loop, but with a long tail extending downwards. The loop of the 5 is open at the top, curving slightly inward towards the right side. 

To draw a simplified version of the number 5, start by sketching an elongated oval shape for the loop, tilting it diagonally from left to right. Then, continue the line downwards to create a long straight tail. The loop should be larger than the tail.

The distinctive feature of the number 5 is its long, descending tail. Make sure the tail extends below the baseline of the digit. The proportion between the loop and tail is important, as the loop should take up the majority of the digit's height.

When aligning the 5 with other elements or digits, keep in mind that the loop should slant towards the right, while the tail should point downwards. The space between the loop and tail should be clear and distinguishable.

In summary, the simplified representation of the number 5 is a tilted loop with an open top that curves slightly inward towards the right, and a long tail descending below the baseline.
