The number 5 can be simplified into a distinctive shape resembling an uppercase letter "S" with a small horizontal line at the top and bottom. 

Start by drawing a vertical line from the top to the bottom, slightly tilted towards the right. Next, connect the top of the line with a curved line that moves in a downward direction, curves towards the right, and then curves back upwards to form a smooth arc. This arc should cover approximately 70% of the vertical line's length. 

At the bottom end of the vertical line, draw a shorter horizontal line in the leftward direction, which should be about one-third the length of the vertical line. This short line should be parallel to the ground and positioned slightly above it. 

Imagine the number 5 as a mix of a tilted "S" shape and a horizontal line at its base. Remember, the curved arc on the right side is the most important feature, giving the digit its defining shape.
