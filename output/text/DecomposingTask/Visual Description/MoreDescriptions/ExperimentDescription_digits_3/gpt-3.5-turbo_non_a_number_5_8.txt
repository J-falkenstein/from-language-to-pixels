To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the digit 5, I would describe its fundamental shape and distinctive features. The digit 5 consists of two straight lines and a curved line. 

Start by drawing a vertical line from top to bottom for the main body of the digit. Halfway down the vertical line, imagine a horizontal line extending towards the right. This horizontal line will act as the upper part of the digit. 

Next, from the end of the horizontal line on the right side, draw a diagonal line pointing downwards and to the left. This diagonal line should slant nearly half the length of the vertical line and curve gently towards its end.

Finally, imagine a small vertical line extending downwards at the end of the curved diagonal line. This will complete the bottom part of the digit.

Remember, the vertical line and the curved diagonal line are the key distinguishing features of the digit 5. The vertical line serves as the backbone, while the curved diagonal line adds a unique shape. Focus on these main elements to create a recognizable representation of the digit 5.
