The number 6 is similar to a reversed 9. It starts with a curved line starting from the top left and going downwards towards the right. The curve loops inwards and then back outwards to create a circular shape. At the bottom of this circular shape, there is a straight horizontal line that connects the left and right sides of the circular shape. This line should be positioned slightly above the center of the circular shape. The overall structure should resemble a rounded, closed loop with a straight line at the bottom.
