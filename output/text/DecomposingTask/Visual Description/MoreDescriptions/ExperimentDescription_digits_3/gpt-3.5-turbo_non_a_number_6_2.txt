The number 6 has a rounded, curved shape resembling the letter 'C' lying horizontally. Begin by drawing a small circle starting from the top left of your paper. From the right side of this circle, draw a curved line that smoothly bends to the left and continues downwards, forming the outer curve of the 'C' shape. To distinguish it from the letter 'C,' you'll add a small horizontal line extending outwards from the bottom right side of the curved line, just a little below the center. This line should be parallel to the ground and shorter than the width of the circle. These simple elements represent the number 6, with the upper circle and the curved line forming the main body, and the small line indicating the ending point of the curve.
