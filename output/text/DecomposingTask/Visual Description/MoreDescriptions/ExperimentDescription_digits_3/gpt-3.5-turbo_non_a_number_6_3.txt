To draw a simplified version of the number 6, imagine an elongated oval shape tilted slightly towards the right side. The top left part of the oval should be flat, curving smoothly towards the right and descending in a gentle curve. This curved line then continues to form a clockwise loop at the bottom, starting from the right and rising up towards the left side of the oval. The loop should be smaller in size compared to the top part of the oval. 

Ensure that the top and bottom parts of the oval are aligned vertically, with the loop starting around the middle of the oval's height. The loop should not touch or intersect the top or bottom lines of the oval, leaving a small space on both ends. This will help distinguish it from other similar numbers.

Remember, the key elements to focus on are the elongated oval, the gentle curve on the right side, and the clockwise loop at the bottom. By following these instructions, a simplified version of the number 6 can be drawn even without the need for intricate details.
