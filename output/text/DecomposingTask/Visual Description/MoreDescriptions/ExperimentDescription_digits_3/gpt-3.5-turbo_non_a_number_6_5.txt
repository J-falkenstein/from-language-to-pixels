To draw a simplified version of the number 6, imagine a curved line starting from the top left and sloping gently towards the bottom right. This line should be positioned at a slight angle, leaning towards the right side. The curve should be smooth and rounded, resembling a backward "C" shape.

At the top of this curve, there should be a small horizontal line that connects to the left side of the curve. This mini-line is located near the top left corner and acts as the starting point for the curve.

Towards the bottom of the curve, there should be a small, curved hook-like shape protruding towards the right. This hook should be short and distinct, resembling a small elongated "U" nestled within the curve. It should be placed on the right side of the curve, slightly lower than the middle point of the curve.

Remember to keep the overall shape smooth, the curve facing towards the right, and the hook-like shape visible on the right side of the curve. By following these simplified instructions, one can create a recognizable representation of the number 6.
