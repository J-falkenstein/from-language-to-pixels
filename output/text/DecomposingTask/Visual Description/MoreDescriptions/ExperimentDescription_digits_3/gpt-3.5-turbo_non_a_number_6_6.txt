To draw a simplified version of the number 6, imagine a small circle slightly tilted to the right. The top part of the circle begins just below the center and forms a smooth curve downwards towards the right. While the bottom part of the circle curves outwards to the left, it extends a bit farther before curving upwards to meet the top part again. These two curves create the shape of the digit 6. The top curve should be larger and more pronounced than the bottom one. Remember that the circle is slightly tilted, with the right side being higher than the left.
