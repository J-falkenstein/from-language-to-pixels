To a blind person, here's how I would describe the shape of the digit "6":

The number 6 has a rounded, circular shape resembling a lowercase letter "o." Imagine starting at the top center and draw a smooth curve that goes clockwise, creating a rounded line that moves down to the right. Keep the curve smooth and gradually flatten it out as you reach the bottom right corner, forming a slightly slanted, short horizontal line. This line should be positioned just below the middle of the circular shape, extending to the right side. 

The most distinctive feature of the number 6 is a small curve or hook that extends from the end of the short horizontal line, curving inward like a tiny tail or a hook facing left. This part should be positioned below the circular shape and aligned with the end of the horizontal line.

Remember to focus on maintaining the overall rounded shape of the digit while emphasizing the curve, and the small hook or tail on the bottom right side. These key features are essential for recognizing the digit 6, so feel free to simplify any other unnecessary details and focus on these fundamental characteristics.
