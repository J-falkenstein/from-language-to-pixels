The number 6 is a curved shape that resembles a lowercase letter "c" or a backward "9". Start by drawing a small circle, then draw a curved line that starts from the top-left of the circle and arcs inward until it almost reaches the bottom-right of the circle. Keep the curve smooth and continuous. 

To distinguish the number 6 from other similar shapes, make sure the curve is not too loose or too tight. The curve should be moderately rounded, not too sharp or angular. It should also be noticeably larger than other curves or shapes nearby.

The number 6 is typically taller than it is wide, with the curve extending vertically for about two-thirds of the total height. The top of the curve should align with the top of the circle, while the bottom of the curve should align with the bottom of the circle.

Overall, the most important aspect of the number 6 is its distinct curved shape, resembling a lowercase "c" or a backward "9". Focus on capturing the smooth, moderately rounded curve and its vertical alignment within a circle.
