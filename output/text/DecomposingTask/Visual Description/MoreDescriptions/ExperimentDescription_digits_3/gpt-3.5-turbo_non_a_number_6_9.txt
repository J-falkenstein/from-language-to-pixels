To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 6, I would describe it as follows:

"The number 6 is composed of a curved line that starts at the top left and arcs smoothly downwards and then curving back up to the right, forming a rounded and closed loop. The loop should be slightly taller than wide, with the top portion curving more than the bottom part. The top of the loop aligns with the middle of the vertical stem, which is a straight line extending downwards from the loop's center. The stem is about two-thirds the height of the loop and is positioned slightly to the right, aligning with the right side of the loop's bottom curve. Overall, the number 6 has a distinct shape resembling a lowercase 'b' that is rounded and closed."

Remember to provide additional guidance or answer any questions the blind person may have to ensure they can accurately understand and replicate the shape of the digit.
