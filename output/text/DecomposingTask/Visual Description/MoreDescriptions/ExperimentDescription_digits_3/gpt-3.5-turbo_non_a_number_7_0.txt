To draw a simplified version of the number 7, imagine an almost straight vertical line that stands tall and narrow, similar to a slender tower. 

Starting from the top, at about two-thirds of the total height, picture a gentle curve leaning slightly to the right. This curve should be like a small bend, softening the sharpness of the straight line. 

Below that curve, continue with a longer horizontal line pointing towards the right. This line should be placed just a bit lower than the center of the vertical line.

The bottom end of the horizontal line should have another slight upward curve, mirroring the curve at the top but in the opposite direction. This curve should be shorter and less pronounced than the upper one.

Remember, the most crucial elements of the number 7 are the straight vertical line, the right-leaning curve at the top, and the longer horizontal line extending to the right. The other details are not essential for its recognition.
