The digit 7 has a fundamental shape of a vertical line with a shorter horizontal line attached towards the top. The vertical line is straight and extends downwards from the topmost point. The length of this line is roughly two times the length of the horizontal line. 

The distinctive feature of the digit 7 is the presence of the shorter horizontal line that is connected to the vertical line slightly below its top end. This horizontal line is positioned diagonally, sloping towards the right side of the vertical line. It is approximately one-third the length of the vertical line.

To describe the proportions and alignments, imagine the vertical line starting at the top and extending downwards, centered within a rectangular area. The horizontal line is attached to the right side of the vertical line, positioned a little below the top, and sloping diagonally towards the right upper corner of the rectangle.

Please note that these instructions are simplified to help create a basic representation of the digit 7.
