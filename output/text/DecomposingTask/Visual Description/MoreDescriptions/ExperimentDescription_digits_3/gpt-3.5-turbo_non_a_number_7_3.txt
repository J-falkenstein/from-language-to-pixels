To draw a simplified version of the number 7, imagine a vertical line, straight and tall like a flagpole. Start from the top and go straight down until you reach about two-thirds of the way down the imaginary paper. At this point, slightly angle the line towards the right, slanting gently like a forward slash (/). This slanted line should be shorter than the first vertical line, reaching only about halfway down. 

Now, picture a shorter horizontal line that starts from the right end of the slanted line and extends towards the left. This line should be positioned just below the top of the slanted line and should be about half the length of the vertical line. It aligns horizontally with the top endpoint of the slanted line.

This horizontal line somewhat resembles an underline, but placed above the slanted line. It serves as the distinctive feature of the number 7. 

Remember, the vertical line is the longest, the slanted line is shorter and positioned at an angle towards the right, and the horizontal line is shorter still, aligning with the top of the slanted line. By capturing these key elements in your drawing, you will create a simplified representation of the number 7 that can be recognized.
