To describe the visual characteristics of the number 7 to a blind person, follow these guidelines:

1. Start with the fundamental shape: The number 7 has a vertical line on the left side and a shorter horizontal line crossing it towards the upper-right side.

2. Describe the distinctive features: The vertical line is long and straight, extending from the top to the bottom. It is the most prominent element of the digit. The horizontal line is shorter and positioned diagonally, starting from the middle of the vertical line and extending towards the upper-right side.

3. Explain the proportions: The vertical line is usually longer than the horizontal line, giving the digit a taller appearance. The length of the horizontal line is approximately one-third or one-fourth of the vertical line.

4. Highlight alignments and spatial relationships: The horizontal line is positioned diagonally upwards, starting from the middle of the vertical line and slanting towards the upper-right side. It intersects the vertical line slightly above its mid-point, creating a distinctive angle.

In summary, the number 7 is characterized by a long vertical line on the left side along with a shorter horizontal line crossing it diagonally towards the upper-right side. The vertical line is taller, while the horizontal line forms a slight angle when intersecting.
