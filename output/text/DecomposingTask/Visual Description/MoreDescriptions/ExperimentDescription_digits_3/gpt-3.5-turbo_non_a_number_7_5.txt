To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the digit 7, I would describe its fundamental shape and distinctive features using clear and concise language. Here's how I would describe it:

"The digit 7 has a vertical, straight line as its main shape. The line starts at the top and goes straight down to the bottom. It is slightly taller than most other digits, reaching from the top edge of the drawing area to about one-third of the way down the page. At the top of the vertical line, there is a short horizontal line that extends towards the right, about one-fourth of the way down the vertical line. This line is positioned slightly towards the right side of the vertical line. 

Together, these two lines create the basic structure of the digit 7. It is important to maintain the straightness of the vertical line and the horizontal line's alignment with the right side of the vertical line to ensure recognition. Remember to leave enough space between the two lines so that they are distinct from each other. 

By focusing on these key elements - the vertical line, the short horizontal line towards the right, and their relative proportions and alignments - you will be able to draw a simplified version of the digit 7."
