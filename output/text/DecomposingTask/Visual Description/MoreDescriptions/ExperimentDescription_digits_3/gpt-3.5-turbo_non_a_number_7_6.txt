To draw a simplified version of the digit 7, start by imagining an upright line, just like the letter "I." It should be vertical and extend from the top to the bottom of your drawing area. 

Now, visualize a shorter horizontal line attached to the top end of the vertical line, positioned just a little below the upper edge. This horizontal line should be slightly slanted downward, forming an angle with the vertical line. 

The key feature of the number 7 is a diagonal line that starts at the top of the vertical line, curves slightly to the right, and then slants diagonally downwards to the right. This diagonal line should be shorter than the vertical line and end either at the bottom of the vertical line or slightly above it. 

Remember to differentiate the lengths of the horizontal line, the vertical line, and the diagonal line in your drawing, with the vertical line being the longest.

By incorporating these fundamental features into your drawing, someone can recognize it as the digit 7 even without intricate details.
