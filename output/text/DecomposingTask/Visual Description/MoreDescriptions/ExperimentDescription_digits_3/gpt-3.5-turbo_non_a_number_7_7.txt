The digit 7 can be described as a straight vertical line with a small horizontal line crossing it towards the top. Imagine drawing a tall, slender stick from top to bottom. Now, visualize a shorter line intersecting the stick about one-third of the way down from the top. This shorter line extends towards the right side of the stick, but it doesn't touch the stick's end. It forms a little hook or a short slanted line, pointing to the right. The positioning of this shorter line is crucial as it distinguishes the digit from other numbers.
