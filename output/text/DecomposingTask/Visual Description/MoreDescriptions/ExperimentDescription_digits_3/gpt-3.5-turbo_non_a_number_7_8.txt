The number 7 can be described as a tall and slender digit. It has a vertical line as the main feature, which starts from the top and goes straight down to the bottom. The line is slightly angled to the right. 

At the top, there is a small horizontal line that extends towards the right, almost like a short arm coming out from the vertical line. It is positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line. 

The bottom part of the vertical line connects to a small curve, starting from the right side, then curving leftward and upward, ending close to the vertical line. This curve is somewhat similar to a backward "L" shape.

To summarize:
- Start with a tall and slender vertical line, slightly angled to the right.
- Near the top, add a short horizontal line extending to the right, positioned slightly above the middle of the vertical line.
- Connect the bottom part of the vertical line to a small curve, starting from the right side, then curving leftward and upward towards the vertical line.

Remember, simplicity is key in describing these features to a blind person, so focusing on the most essential aspects will help them create a recognizable simplified version of the number 7.
