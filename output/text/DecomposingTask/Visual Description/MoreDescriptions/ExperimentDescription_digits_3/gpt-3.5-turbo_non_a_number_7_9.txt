The digit "7" has a straight vertical line as its fundamental shape. Imagine drawing a tall and straight line, starting from the top and extending downwards. This line should be placed slightly towards the right side of the drawing area.

To distinguish it from other digits, the top of the vertical line should have a horizontal line extending towards the right, creating a small and short horizontal stroke. This stroke is positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line and should be approximately half the length of the vertical line.

That's it! The key features of the digit 7 are a straight vertical line with a short horizontal stroke positioned towards the top-right. Remember to mention the alignment of the vertical line towards the right and the proportions of the horizontal stroke compared to the vertical line.
