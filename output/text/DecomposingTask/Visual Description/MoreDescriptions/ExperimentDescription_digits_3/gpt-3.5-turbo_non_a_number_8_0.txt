The digit 8 has a fundamental shape that resembles two overlapping circles. Start by drawing a slightly tilted vertical line, then draw a smaller horizontal line crossing the vertical line at the center. On the top end of the vertical line, draw a curved line that moves to the left and loops downwards, forming a rounded shape. This rounded shape continues downwards, crossing the horizontal line and curving back up towards the right side, creating a symmetrical loop. The loop then curves upwards and intersects with the top end of the vertical line. Repeat the same process on the bottom end of the vertical line to create another symmetrical loop in the opposite direction. The two loops should be approximately the same size and shape. Remember to keep the curves smooth and gentle.
