The number 8 is like two circles stacked one on top of the other. Imagine drawing a small circle, and then slightly below that, draw a larger circle that overlaps the bottom part of the smaller circle. 

Starting at the top of the smaller circle, draw a curved line downward towards the right, following the contour of the circle. Once you reach the bottom, continue the line upwards to the top of the larger circle. 

Now, starting at the top of the larger circle on the right side, draw a curved line downward towards the left, again following the contour of the circle. Once you reach the bottom, continue the line upwards to the top of the smaller circle. 

The two curved lines should meet at the top and bottom parts of the circles, creating a sort of "hourglass" shape. 

Remember to keep the lines smooth and round, without any sharp turns or corners. This will help highlight the circular nature of the number 8.
