To draw a simplified version of the number 8, imagine two circles stacked vertically, one on top of the other. The circles should be roughly the same size and aligned in the center. Start at the top circle and smoothly curve downward to the right, forming a loop that connects to the bottom circle. Then, continue curving upward to the left to create another loop that meets the top circle again. This creates the overall shape of an "S" or an "Infinity symbol" lying on its side. The loops should be symmetrical and nearly touch each other at the top and bottom points. Remember to keep the curves smooth and flowing.
