The number 8 can be described as two circles that are connected together. The circles are of equal size and are positioned horizontally next to each other. They are slightly elongated and are touching at one point in the middle. The upper circle appears like a mirrored reflection of the lower circle. The top and bottom parts of the circles have a slight curve, creating a smooth transition. The two circles together form a figure of a number 8.
