The digit 8 has a round and symmetrical shape. Imagine drawing two equal-sized circles next to each other, touching slightly at their centers. The top circle should be slightly smaller than the bottom one. 

Starting from the top circle, imagine a curved line that flows fluidly down to the bottom circle, forming a clockwise curve. At the bottom, the curve continues upwards, transitioning smoothly into another clockwise curve that reaches the top circle again.

To distinguish the digit 8, emphasize the two loops or curves, making them clearly rounded and distinct. They should be similar in size and symmetrically positioned. Keep the lines smooth and avoid sharp angles or corners. The digit 8 should represent a continuous movement resembling two interconnected loops.
