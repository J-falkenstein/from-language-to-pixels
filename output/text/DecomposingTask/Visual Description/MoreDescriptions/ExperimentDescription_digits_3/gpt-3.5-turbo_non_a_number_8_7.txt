The digit 8 has the shape of two circles stacked vertically. The upper circle is slightly smaller than the lower one, and they are connected by two short straight lines that are positioned horizontally. The circles are aligned in the center, with the upper circle overlapping the lower one slightly. The top part of the upper circle is open, resembling a small letter "C" facing left. Similarly, the bottom part of the lower circle is open, looking like a small letter "C" facing right. The circles are evenly spaced and symmetrical, with the upper and lower curves curving outwards smoothly. To draw a simplified version of the digit 8, you can focus on the two stacked circles and their connected straight lines, leaving out any extra details or curves.
