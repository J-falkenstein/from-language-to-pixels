The number 8 can be described as two circles stacked vertically on top of each other. The top circle is slightly smaller than the bottom one. Start by drawing a medium-sized circle at the top of your paper, then draw a slightly larger circle directly underneath it. The circles should touch each other, creating a figure-eight shape. The top circle's center should align with the middle of the bottom circle. The bottom circle should be wider and more elongated horizontally compared to the top one. Remember to keep the lines smooth and rounded to indicate the curves of the circles. After drawing the basic shape, you can add tactile or auditory cues, such as describing the gap between the two circles as a narrow bridge or mentioning that the top circle is smaller to help the blind person understand the proportions.
