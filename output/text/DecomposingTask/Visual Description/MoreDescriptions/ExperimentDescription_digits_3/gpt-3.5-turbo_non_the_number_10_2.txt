To draw the number 10, imagine a straight vertical line first. This line will serve as the main body of the digit. 

Next, at the top right end of the line, draw a small circle or dot. This circular shape represents the number 1. It should be relatively smaller compared to the main line, resembling a sun or a tiny dot on a paper.

Ensure that the circle or dot sits slightly above the middle of the vertical line. This alignment will indicate the spatial relationship between the two elements. 

Remember, the vertical line represents the zero in the number 10, while the circle or dot represents the one. 

By drawing a straight line for zero and a small circle or dot for one, you will successfully depict the number 10 in a simplified manner.
