To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 10, I would describe it as follows:

1. Start by drawing a vertical line from top to bottom, almost the length of the paper. This vertical line represents the stem of the number.

2. At the very top of the stem, draw a small curve bending towards the right side. This curve forms the hook or serif at the top of the number.

3. To the right of the stem, draw a small, round dot or circle. This dot sits just above the bottom half of the vertical line and is slightly to the right of it. The dot represents the number's zero.

So, to recap, imagine a long vertical stem with a small curve at the top forming a hook or serif, and a round dot sitting just above the bottom half of the stem towards the right side.
