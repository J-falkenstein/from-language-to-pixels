To draw the number 10, start by imagining a vertical line going straight down. At the top of this line, there is a little horizontal line that extends only to the right. This horizontal line is like a mini dash, sticking out from the top right of the vertical line. It's slightly tilted downwards. The vertical line below this dash goes all the way down and stops at the same level as the middle point of the horizontal line.

In simple terms, the number 10 looks like a long stick with a small, short stick sticking out near the top right side.
