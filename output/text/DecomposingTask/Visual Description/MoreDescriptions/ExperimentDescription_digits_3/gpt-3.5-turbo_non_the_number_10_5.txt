To enable a blind person to draw a simplified version of the number 10, I would describe it as follows:

1. The number 10 consists of two digits, the digit "1" and the digit "0".
2. Begin with the digit "1," which is a vertical line standing straight and tall. It should start from the top and go all the way down to the bottom.
3. On the right side of the vertical line of the digit "1," add a small circle next to it, touching the line vertically. This circle represents the digit "0."
4. The circle should be aligned with the bottom end of the digit "1" to create a visually connected appearance.
5. The circle should be smaller than the vertical line of digit "1" and should not extend beyond its top or bottom limits.
6. The position of the circle is crucial, as it indicates the digit "0" being added to the digit "1."

Remember, this description focuses on the main elements and relationship between the digits "1" and "0," allowing the blind person to create a simplified representation of the number 10.
