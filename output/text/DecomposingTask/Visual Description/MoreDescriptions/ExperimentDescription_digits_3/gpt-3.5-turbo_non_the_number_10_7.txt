To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 10, here's a visual description:

1. Start with a vertical line as the fundamental shape of the digit.
2. The vertical line is relatively longer than other digits, extending from top to bottom.
3. Towards the top of the line, a small horizontal line intersects it, creating a T-shape.
4. The horizontal line is positioned slightly above the halfway point of the vertical line.
5. The horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line, but long enough to be noticeable.
6. The horizontal line should align almost perfectly perpendicular to the vertical line.
7. The horizontal line is essential to recognize the digit, as it forms the distinctive feature.
8. Ensure the spacing between the two lines is slightly smaller than the length of the horizontal line.

By following these instructions, the blind person should be able to draw a simplified version of the digit 10.
