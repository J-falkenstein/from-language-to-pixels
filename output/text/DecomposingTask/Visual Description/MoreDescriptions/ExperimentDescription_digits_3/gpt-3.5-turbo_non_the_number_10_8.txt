To draw the number 10, imagine a straight vertical line that stands upright like a tall pole. At its top, slightly to the right, draw a small circle shape. This circle represents the 0 in the number 10. Make sure it is situated close enough to the top end of the vertical line to show that it's a part of the digit. Remember, the circle should be noticeably smaller than the length of the vertical line. That's it! You've successfully described the shape of the number 10.
