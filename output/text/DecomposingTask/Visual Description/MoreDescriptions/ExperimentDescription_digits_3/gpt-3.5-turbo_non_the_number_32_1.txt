To describe the visual characteristics of the number 32 to a blind person, you can say:

"The number 32 is formed by two separate digits, namely the number 3 and the number 2. Let's start with the digit 3. It has a rounded shape, similar to a lowercase letter 'c'. Begin from the top-left corner and curve your line downwards in a smooth arc until you reach the bottom-right corner. Then, move slightly upwards and create a shorter and straight horizontal line that connects to the right side of the curve, near the bottom. This shorter line should be placed slightly below the middle of the curve. 

Next, let's move on to the digit 2. It has a distinct shape resembling a lowercase letter 'n'. Begin by drawing a diagonal line slanting upwards from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. Then, starting slightly below where the diagonal line ends, draw a smooth and rounded curve downwards, following the same motion as the letter 'u'. This curve should reach close to the bottom of the diagonal line but not touch it.

When you have completed drawing both digits, position them side by side with a small and equal gap between them. The digit 3 should be on the left, while the digit 2 on the right. Ensure that the top of both digits align horizontally. The gap between them should be approximately the same size as the curved part of the digit 3. This will give an accurate representation of the number 32."

Please note that this description focuses on the simplified form of the digits and does not include additional details or proportions.
