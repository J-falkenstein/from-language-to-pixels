To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 32, you can describe the following visual characteristics:

1. Shape: Start by drawing a medium-sized oval in a vertical orientation. This oval will serve as the base shape for the number 3.

2. Distinctive Features - Number 3: On the right side of the oval, towards the top, draw a curved arc that gently slopes downwards to the right. This arc should be about half the height of the oval and almost touch its right side. This curve gives number 3 its characteristic shape.

3. Distinctive Features - Number 2: Just below the oval's midpoint, draw a slightly tilted line in a backward slash (/) orientation. This line should be around one-third of the oval's height and curve gently to the left at the bottom. The backward slash, resembling a slight angle, represents the number 2.

4. Proportions: Ensure that the oval is a bit taller than it is wide, with the curved arc on the right being slightly smaller in comparison. The backward slash (number 2) should also be approximately one-third the height of the oval.

5. Alignment and Spatial Relationships: The curved arc of number 3 should be positioned on the right side of the oval, almost touching it. The backward slash of number 2 should be placed just below the midpoint of the oval, slightly tilted to the left, and curving gently at the bottom.

By following these descriptions, a blind person can create a simplified representation of the number 32. Remember, simplicity is key, so focus on the essential elements that make the number recognizable without overwhelming with unnecessary details.
