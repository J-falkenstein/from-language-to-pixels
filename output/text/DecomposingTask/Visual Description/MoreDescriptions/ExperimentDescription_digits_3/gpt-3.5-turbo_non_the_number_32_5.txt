The number 32 can be drawn as a combination of two separate digits, 3 and 2. 

To represent the digit 3, imagine a curved line starting from the top left corner and moving diagonally downwards to the right, curving smoothly at the bottom, and then moving upwards to the right. The shape resembles a backward letter "C" with a small bump at the top right. The closed loop of the "C" is more rounded than angular. 

For the digit 2, envision a slightly curved line starting from the top left corner and moving diagonally downwards to the right. At around one-third of the way down, abruptly curve the line to the left, forming a loop-like shape. Connecting the bottom of this loop, draw a slightly curved horizontal line extending towards the right. The 2 resembles a sideways letter "S" with a loop at the top and a small tail at the bottom. 

When drawing the number 32, place the digit 3 on top and the digit 2 right beneath it. These digits should be aligned on the left side, sharing the same vertical line. The top of the 2 should be slightly below the top of the 3, and the loop of the 2 should be smaller than the curve of the 3. 

Remember, it is crucial to emphasize the general shapes and distinctive features of the digits while omitting intricate details.
