To describe the visual characteristics of the number 32 to a blind person, I would say:

"The number 32 can be represented by a rounded shape that is similar to a circle. Starting from the top, draw a slightly curved line to the right, forming the top part of the digit. Then, draw a straight vertical line downwards from the end of the curved line. This vertical line should be longer than the curved line, extending downwards. 

At the bottom of the vertical line, draw another slightly curved line to the left, connecting it back towards the start of the first curved line to close the shape. This second curved line should be smaller and shorter in comparison to the first curved line. It should slightly resemble a partially closed loop, but not completely.

Remember, the curved lines should be gentle, without sharp edges. The upper curved line should be larger and more pronounced, while the lower curved line should be smaller and less prominent. These distinctions will help differentiate the two parts of the digit.

The key features to focus on are the rounded shape, the slightly curved lines, and the vertical line that separates the two curved lines. Ensure that the top curved line is larger and more prominent, and the bottom curved line is smaller and less emphasized. This way, when you draw it, others will recognize it as the number 32."
