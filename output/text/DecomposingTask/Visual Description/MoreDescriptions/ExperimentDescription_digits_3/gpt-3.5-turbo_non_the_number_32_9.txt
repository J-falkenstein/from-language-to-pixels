The number 32 has a rounded and curvy shape. It starts with a slightly slanted line that moves upwards to the left from the bottom left corner. This line is shorter than the entire height of the number. At the end of this line, there is a small horizontal line that extends to the right. 

From the top right corner of this initial line, a curved line starts, moving downwards and curving slightly to the left. This line is longer than the initial line and curves smoothly until it intersects with the horizontal line placed earlier. The curve of this line is important to distinguish the number.

To summarize, imagine a slightly slanted line moving upwards to the left, with a shorter horizontal line extending to the right from its end. From the top right corner of the initial line, a longer curved line moves downwards and curves slightly to the left, intersecting with the horizontal line. The proportions should be such that the initial line is shorter than the overall height of the number.

Remember, these descriptions aim to highlight the essential features and proportions of the digit 32, without going into intricate details.
