The number 9 is shaped like a lowercase letter "g" but without the loop. It starts with a straight vertical line pointing downward from the top. At the bottom, the line curves sharply to the left in a semi-circle shape that is open at the top. This curve extends back up towards the starting point, but not fully to the top. The top of the curve is slightly slanted towards the right, creating a little diagonal line that is parallel to the initial vertical line. The diagonal line is shorter than the vertical line. The combination of the vertical line, the semi-circle, and the short slanted diagonal line make up the distinct features of the number 9.
