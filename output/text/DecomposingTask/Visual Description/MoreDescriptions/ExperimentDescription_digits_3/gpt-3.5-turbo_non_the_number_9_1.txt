To draw the number "9," imagine a large and round balloon. Start at the top by drawing a small loop, as if you're making a lowercase "g." Then, smoothly curve downward, creating a much larger loop in a clockwise direction. This loop should be similar in size to the upper loop, but wider. Imagine it as a big belly. 

As you reach the bottom of the belly loop, continue the curve upwards towards the right, slightly slanting to the left. Think of it as the back of a chair, with the belly loop as the seat and the upward curve as the backrest. 

Once you've reached the top, extend the line straight down, to about half the length of the belly loop. This straight line should be aligned with the left side of the belly loop. It acts as the leg of the number "9," giving it support. 

Lastly, at the bottom, close the loop by connecting the end of the line to the beginning of the small loop you initially drew. This closing line should be parallel to the top of the belly loop and similar in length to the leg. It completes the shape of the number "9." 

Remember, emphasize the size difference between the two loops, the clockwise direction of the larger belly loop, the slanted upward curve, and the straight leg aligned with the left side of the belly loop.
