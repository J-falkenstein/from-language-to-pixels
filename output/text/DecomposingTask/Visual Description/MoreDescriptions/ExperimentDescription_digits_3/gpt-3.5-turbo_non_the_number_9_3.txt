The digit 9 has a fundamental shape similar to the number 6, but with a vertical stroke on the right side. It starts with a curved line that begins at the top left and loops in a counter-clockwise direction, curving back towards the top right. At the bottom of this curved line, there is a straight vertical stroke that extends downward, ending slightly below the baseline. The vertical stroke is shorter than the curved line above it. The loop of the 9 is more rounded compared to the 6. It is important to position the vertical stroke properly on the right side of the curve, maintaining a small distance between them. Remember to keep the loop open and distinct from the vertical stroke to make it recognizable as a 9.
