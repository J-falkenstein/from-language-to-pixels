The number 9 has a rounded shape, similar to an oval tilted slightly to the right. It starts with a small curved line that slopes downward and then curves inward, forming the top-left portion of the oval shape. From there, it continues with a large curved line that flows downwards and to the right, creating a loop-like structure. This loop is significant as it forms the main body of the digit. As the loop descends towards the bottom, it gradually curves back up and to the left, forming a smaller, rounded and closed loop on the lower right side. This smaller loop creates the bottom-right portion of the oval shape. 

To help with proportions, imagine the oval shape being divided into three parts vertically. The top portion (corresponding to the initial curved line) occupies about one-third of the height. The loop, forming the main body, occupies the central one-third, and the bottom-right loop completes the remaining one-third. It's important to note that the loop in the middle should be more substantial than the bottom-right loop, creating a noticeable contrast between these two loops.

Overall, the number 9 can be simplified as a slightly tilted oval shape connected by two loops, one larger and one smaller.
