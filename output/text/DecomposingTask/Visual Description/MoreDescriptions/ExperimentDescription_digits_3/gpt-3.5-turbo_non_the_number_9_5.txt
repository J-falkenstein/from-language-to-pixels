To help a blind person draw a simplified version of the number 9, here is a visual description:

The digit 9 has a round and slightly elongated shape resembling a lowercase "g" or a tilted egg. Start by drawing a small circle or oval to represent the top part of the digit. From the bottom right of this shape, extend a diagonal line downwards and to the left, reaching almost to the bottom. This line should be slanted at about a 45-degree angle.

From the end of the diagonal line, draw a curved line that smoothly connects back to the top of the circle or oval, creating a rounded loop shape. This loop should be larger and more pronounced than the top part of the digit. It should curve from the bottom left to the bottom right, imitating the shape of a lowercase "g" or a very tilted egg.

Remember, the top part of the digit 9 is smaller and more circular, while the bottom loop is larger and rounded. The diagonal line connects these two parts and gives the digit its unique appearance. Focus on ensuring the overall shape resembles a "g" or a tilted egg, capturing the key elements needed to recognize the number 9.
