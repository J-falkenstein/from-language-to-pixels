The number 9 has a circular shape, similar to a small balloon or a lowercase letter 'g'. Start by drawing a round shape, which will be the body of the 9. The top curve of the circle should be slightly smaller than the bottom curve. 

From the bottom right side of the circle, draw a diagonal line slanting towards the top left. This line should be angled inwards, just a bit past the center of the circle. It will form the tail of the 9. 

Now, at the top right side of the circle, draw a shorter diagonal line slanting towards the bottom left. This line should start a little below the top of the circle and end just above the diagonal tail line. It will form the upper part of the 9.

To complete the number 9, draw a small, curved line connecting the end of the tail to the bottom left side of the circle. This line should be gentle and curved, similar to a lowercase letter 'c'. It will close the top part of the 9.

Remember, the main features of the 9 are its circular shape, the diagonal tail slanting towards the left, and the curved line connecting the tail to the bottom left side of the circle.
