The number 9 has a round shape with a curved line that starts at the top left, goes down in a smooth arc, and then loops back up to the right. Imagine it as a lowercase letter "g" without the tail. The top part of the 9 is similar to a small circle with a straight line coming out of its right side and going downwards. This line then curves to the left, forming the rounded part of the digit. The bottom loop of the 9 is wider and larger than the top circle. It starts on the right side of the top loop, goes down and curves to the left, forming a semicircular shape. The bottom loop connects to the end point of the top line, creating a continuous flow. The overall shape of the 9 is tall, and the bottom loop is larger than the top loop. Remember to keep the curves smooth and rounded throughout the digit.
