"""The capital letter A is a triangular shape with a horizontal line at the top and two slanted lines extending downward from the ends of the horizontal line. The horizontal line is shorter than the slanted lines, and the slanted lines converge at a point below the horizontal line, forming a triangular shape. The left slanted line starts at the top left corner and slopes downward to the right, while the right slanted line starts at the top right corner and slopes downward to the left. The space between the slanted lines is open, creating a clear, empty space within the triangular shape."""
