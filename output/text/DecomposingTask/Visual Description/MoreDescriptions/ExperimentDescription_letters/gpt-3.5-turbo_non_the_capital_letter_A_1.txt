The capital letter A is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a point. The left diagonal line starts at the top left corner and angles downwards and to the right, intersecting with the right diagonal line at a point slightly below the midway point. The right diagonal line starts at the top right corner and angles downwards and to the left, intersecting with the left diagonal line. The two diagonal lines are of equal length, creating a triangular shape with the point of intersection at the center. The horizontal line connecting the two diagonal lines is located slightly below the top of the letter and spans the width of the triangular shape. It is parallel to the baseline and centered within the width of the letter. The triangular shape is open at the bottom, with no horizontal line connecting the diagonal lines at the bottom.
