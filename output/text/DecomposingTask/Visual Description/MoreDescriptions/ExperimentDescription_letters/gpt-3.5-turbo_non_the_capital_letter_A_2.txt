"""The capital letter A is composed of three distinct lines. The middle line is a vertical line that starts at the top and extends downwards. On either side of the vertical line, there are two diagonal lines that slant inward towards each other. These diagonal lines start at the top corners and meet at a point just below the middle of the vertical line. The diagonal lines are symmetrical, with the same angle and length on both sides. The bottom portion of the A is open and does not connect to the other lines, forming a distinct triangle shape at the bottom."""
