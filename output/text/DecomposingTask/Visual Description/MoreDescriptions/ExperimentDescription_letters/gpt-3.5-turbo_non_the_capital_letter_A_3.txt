"The capital letter A is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a single point. The line on the left starts at the top left corner of the imaginary square that encompasses the letter and slants downwards and to the right, ending at the bottom middle of the square. The line on the right starts at the top right corner of the square and slants downwards and to the left, crossing over the first line near the middle of the square. The two lines are of equal length and create a symmetrical 'V' shape at the point of intersection. The bottom portion of the letter is an imaginary horizontal line that connects the bottom ends of the diagonal lines, completing the formation of the letter A."
