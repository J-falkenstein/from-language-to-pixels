"""The capital letter A has a triangular shape, with two diagonal lines that meet at a point in the center. The diagonal lines are slanted outward and are of equal length, creating an isosceles triangle. At the bottom of the triangle, there is a horizontal line that connects the two diagonal lines. The diagonal lines are longer than the horizontal line and extend beyond it slightly. The left diagonal line is aligned with the left edge of the horizontal line, while the right diagonal line slightly overlaps the right edge of the horizontal line."""
