"The capital letter A is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a point in the middle of the shape. The left diagonal line starts at the top left corner, slants downwards towards the right, and ends slightly below the middle point. The right diagonal line starts at the top right corner, slants downwards towards the left, and ends at the same point where the left line ends. The two diagonal lines are of equal length and are parallel to each other. At the bottom of the intersecting point, a horizontal line connects the two diagonal lines, creating the base of the letter A. The horizontal line is shorter than the diagonal lines and is aligned with their bottom edges. The shape of the letter A is like an open triangle with a horizontal line at its base."
