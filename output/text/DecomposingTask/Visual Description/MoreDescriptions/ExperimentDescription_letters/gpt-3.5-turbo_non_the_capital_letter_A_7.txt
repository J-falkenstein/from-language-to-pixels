"""The capital letter A is comprised of two diagonal lines that meet at a central point. The diagonal lines are long and slanted, with the left line starting at the top left corner, sloping downwards to the right, and ending at the bottom right corner. The right line starts at the top right corner, sloping downwards to the left, and also ends at the bottom right corner. The two diagonal lines intersect at the bottom right corner, forming a sharp angle. Above the intersection point, there is a horizontal line that connects the two diagonal lines, creating a triangular shape. The distance between the bottom of the horizontal line and the intersection point is shorter than the length of the diagonal lines, giving the letter A its distinctive shape."""
