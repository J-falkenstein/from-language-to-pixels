"The capital letter A is formed by two diagonal lines that meet at a point in the center. The lines slope inward from the top corners, creating a narrow apex where they intersect. The line on the left starts at the top left corner and slopes diagonally to the right, while the line on the right starts at the top right corner and slopes diagonally to the left. Below the apex where the lines meet, there is a horizontal line that connects the two diagonal lines. This horizontal line is positioned slightly above the bottom of the diagonal lines, giving the letter A a triangular shape. The spatial relationship between the lines is such that the diagonal lines are evenly aligned with the outer edges of the horizontal line."
