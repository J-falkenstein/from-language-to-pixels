"The capital letter A has a triangular shape, with two slanted lines that join at the top to form a point. The two slanted lines start at the bottom, converging towards each other in an upward direction. They are parallel and have equal length. At the top, the lines meet and continue straight horizontally, forming a horizontal line that connects them. The bottom part of the A consists of a horizontal line that is parallel to the top line, but shorter in length. It is positioned just below the top line, intersecting with the slanted lines at the bottom. The proportions of the A are such that the slanted lines are longer than the horizontal lines, creating a distinct triangular shape."
