"The capital letter B has a distinct shape that consists of two straight vertical lines that are parallel to each other, with a smaller, curved line connecting them at the top. The vertical lines are evenly spaced apart and are of equal length. The top curved line starts on the left side, curves upwards and then loops back down to the right, creating a rounded shape. The top of the curved line aligns with the top of the vertical lines, and the bottom of the curved line aligns with the bottom of the vertical lines. The overall shape of the letter B is similar to two rectangles stacked on top of each other, connected by the curved line."
