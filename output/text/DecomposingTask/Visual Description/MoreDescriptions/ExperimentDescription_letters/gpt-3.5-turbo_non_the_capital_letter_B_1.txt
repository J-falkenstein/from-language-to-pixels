"The capital letter B is made up of two distinct curved elements. It starts with a vertical straight line on the left side, which is slightly longer than the other curved elements. From the top of this line, there is a half circle that curves towards the right and descends, forming the upper part of the letter. The curve continues downwards and then sharply turns to the left, forming a smaller half circle that is parallel to the first one, but inverted. This smaller half circle curves upwards and connects back to the vertical line on the right side, completing the letter B. Overall, the letter B has a symmetrical shape with the two curved elements aligned in a vertical orientation."
