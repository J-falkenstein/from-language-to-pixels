"The capital letter B is composed of two vertical parallel lines connected at the top by a curved horizontal line. The two vertical lines are of equal length and evenly spaced, forming the outer boundaries of the letter. The top horizontal line, which serves as the bridge between the vertical lines, is slightly curved downwards in the center. This curved line starts on the left side of the letter, gradually arches downwards, and then rises up to connect with the right vertical line. The overall shape of the letter B is similar to an open rectangle with rounded corners and a small protrusion in the center."
