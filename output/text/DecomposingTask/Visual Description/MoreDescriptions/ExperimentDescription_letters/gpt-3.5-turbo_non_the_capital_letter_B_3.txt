"""The capital letter B is composed of two curved lines and one straight line. It has a semi-circular shape, resembling the shape of a bowl or a crescent moon with the rounded part facing upwards. The top part of the B consists of a small curved line that starts on the left side and smoothly curves upwards to the right, forming a half-circle shape. From the highest point of the curve, a straight vertical line extends downwards, aligning with the rightmost point of the half-circle. The vertical line is parallel to the left side of the half-circle and does not intersect it. At the bottom of the vertical line, another curved line begins, curving outwards to the left and downwards, forming a larger semi-circle shape. The bottom curved line is parallel to the top curved line, creating an open space between the two curves. The overall proportion of the B is such that the top curved line is smaller and narrower than the bottom curved line, giving the letter a distinctive appearance. The alignment of the curves and the vertical line is symmetrical, creating a balanced and visually pleasing design."""
