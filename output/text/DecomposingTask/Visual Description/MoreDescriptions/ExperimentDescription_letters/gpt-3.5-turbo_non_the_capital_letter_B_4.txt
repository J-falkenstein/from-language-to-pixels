"""The capital letter B is composed of two straight vertical lines that are parallel and of equal length. These lines are connected by a semi-circular shape that is concave facing towards the right. The top and bottom of the semi-circle meet the vertical lines at precise points, creating a clear and defined form. The vertical lines are aligned with each other, creating a symmetrical and balanced appearance. The overall shape of the letter B resembles two vertical pillars connected by a curved arch."""
