"""The capital letter B is composed of two curved elements. It starts with a vertical line on the left side, slightly curved inward, that extends upwards. Near the top, the line curves sharply to the right and then smoothly transitions into a horizontal line that connects to the right side of the vertical line. This horizontal line is perfectly parallel to the baseline. From the right end of the horizontal line, a second vertical line curves outward and descends, creating an open space within the letter. The bottom of the letter is completed by a curved line that connects the end of the descending line to the starting point of the original vertical line. The top and bottom loops are slightly smaller than the middle section and are aligned horizontally."""
