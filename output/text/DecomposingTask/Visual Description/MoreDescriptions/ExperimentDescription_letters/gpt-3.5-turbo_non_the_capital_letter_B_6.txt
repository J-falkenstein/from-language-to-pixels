"The capital letter B has a distinctive shape that consists of two curved lines. It resembles a slightly elongated letter 'C' on top that has been mirrored horizontally, and a straight vertical line on the right side. The curved top element starts on the left side, curving upwards and then returns to the right, curving downwards and then left again, ending in the middle. This top element is connected to the right side of the vertical line, which aligns straight up and down. The vertical line is slightly shorter than the height of the curved top element, creating an open space between them. The bottom of the vertical line does not connect to any other lines and remains open."
