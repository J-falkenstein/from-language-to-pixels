The capital letter B is composed of two distinct curved elements. It has a vertical line on the left side that starts at the top and curves slightly to the right before descending straight down to the bottom. At the top of the vertical line, there is a half-circle shape that opens to the right. This half-circle starts on the left side, curves upwards and to the right, and then returns to the left, curving downwards and ending in the middle. The vertical line and the curved half-circle are connected at the top left corner of the letter, and they align vertically with each other. The overall shape of the letter B is like a sideways "hourglass" or an "8" that has been pinched in the middle.
