"The capital letter B is composed of two symmetrical vertical lines that are connected by a curved horizontal line. The vertical lines are thick and straight, positioned parallel to each other. They are evenly spaced and extend from the top to the bottom of the letter. The curved horizontal line is located in the middle of the vertical lines, connecting them at a central point. It starts on the left side of the vertical lines, curves outward to the right, and then curves back in towards the center, forming a rounded shape. The bottom section of the B is mostly empty space, with the curved horizontal line creating a clear opening within the letter."
