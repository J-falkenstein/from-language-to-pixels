"""The capital letter B has a fundamental shape that resembles two parallel vertical lines connected by a curved horizontal line. The vertical lines are of equal length and positioned close together, creating a tall and narrow shape. The top of the letter is straight, forming a horizontal line that connects the two vertical lines. The bottom of the letter consists of a curved, semi-circular shape that connects the two vertical lines at their bases. This curved line starts on the left side, curves upwards and then curves back down to the right side, meeting the right vertical line at a lower point. The curved line creates a smooth and rounded bottom section to the letter. The two vertical lines are aligned with each other and with the curved line, forming a harmonious and balanced composition. The letter B is typically drawn with empty interior space, which means that the area within the letter is left blank."""
