"The capital letter D is shaped like a large, curved semicircle that is open on the right side. The curve starts at the top left and gradually slopes down to the bottom right, forming a smooth, rounded shape. The top of the curve is slightly concave, while the bottom is more convex, giving the letter a sense of balance and symmetry. The open right side of the curve creates a gap or space, allowing for a sense of movement and openness within the letter. The overall proportion of the letter D is taller than it is wide, with the curve extending more vertically than horizontally. This creates a sense of stability and vertical alignment with other elements in a composition, as the letter stands upright on its own."
