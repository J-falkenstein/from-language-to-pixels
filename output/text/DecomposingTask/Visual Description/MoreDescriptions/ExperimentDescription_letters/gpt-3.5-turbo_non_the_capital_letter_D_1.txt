"""The capital letter D is composed of a large, curved semicircle that is open on the right side. The bottom of the semicircle is straight and horizontal, while the top of the semicircle gradually curves downward to the right. The straight bottom edge is aligned with the baseline, or imaginary horizontal line upon which the letter rests. The top of the curved semicircle is slightly higher than the midpoint of the straight bottom edge, creating a visually pleasing asymmetry. The empty space within the curved semicircle forms an open, empty interior."""
