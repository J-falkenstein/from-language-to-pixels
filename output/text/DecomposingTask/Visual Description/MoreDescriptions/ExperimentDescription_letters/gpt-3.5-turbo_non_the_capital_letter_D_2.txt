"The capital letter D is composed of a large vertical line that curves slightly to the right at the top. The curve is smooth and begins at the upper left corner of the vertical line, extending to the right and then downwards. The bottom portion of the vertical line is aligned horizontally, creating a flat base for the letter. The overall shape resembles an open semicircle, with a slight tilt towards the right."
