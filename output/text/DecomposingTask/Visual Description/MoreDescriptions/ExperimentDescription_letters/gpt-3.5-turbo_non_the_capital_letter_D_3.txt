"The capital letter D is an asymmetrical shape that resembles a half-circle or a semicircle. The curved portion starts at the top left and smoothly curves downwards towards the bottom right. It is a continuous line without any breaks. The curved portion is wider at the top and gradually narrows towards the bottom. The straight edge of the D is a vertical line that extends downwards from the bottom of the curved portion. It is parallel to the left side of the curved portion, creating a clear alignment. The bottom of the straight edge is level with the bottom of the curved portion, completing the overall shape of the letter D. The entire letter is enclosed and does not have any open spaces within its boundaries."
