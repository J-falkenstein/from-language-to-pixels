"The capital letter D is a curved shape that resembles a half circle or the letter 'C'. The curved element starts at the top left corner and smoothly curves to the right, gradually narrowing towards the bottom. It then extends downwards and forms a straight vertical line that is aligned with the left edge of the bottom curve. The vertical line is slightly shorter than the height of the curve, leaving a small open space between them. The overall shape of the letter D is symmetrical, with the left and right sides mirroring each other."
