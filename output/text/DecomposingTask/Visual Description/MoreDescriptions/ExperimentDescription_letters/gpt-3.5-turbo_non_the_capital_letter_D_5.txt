"The capital letter D is formed by a straight vertical line that starts at the top and extends downward, with a slight curve inwards towards the right at the bottom. At the top of the vertical line, there is a semi-circular shape that is open towards the right side. The semi-circle is positioned at the left side of the vertical line, with its top and bottom aligned with the top and bottom of the vertical line. The open space within the semi-circle forms a clear, empty area within the letter."
