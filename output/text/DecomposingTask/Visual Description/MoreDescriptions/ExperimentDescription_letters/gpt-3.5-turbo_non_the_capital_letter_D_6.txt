The capital letter D appears as a large, curved shape that resembles a semi-circle or half of a circle. The curved part starts at the top left and smoothly arcs downward, then curves back to the right before ending in a straight, vertical line. The straight line extends downward from the rightmost point of the curved part and is aligned with it. The curved part is larger and more prominent than the straight line, forming the rounded shape of the letter. The straight line is shorter in comparison and serves as the vertical stem of the letter. The overall proportions of the D are such that the curved part occupies the majority of the letter's height and width, while the straight line is relatively smaller. The D can be visualized as resembling a lowercase letter 'o' with a vertical line attached to its right side.
