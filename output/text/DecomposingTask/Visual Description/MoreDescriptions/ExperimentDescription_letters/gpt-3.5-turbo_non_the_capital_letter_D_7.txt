"The capital letter D is formed by a large, curved line that resembles the shape of a semi-circle. The line begins at the top left corner, gradually curves downwards in a smooth arc, and ends at the bottom left corner. The curve is concave, meaning it is curving inward towards the center of the shape. The top and bottom of the D are parallel to each other, creating a straight vertical alignment. The inside of the shape is typically left empty, forming an open space within the curved line."
