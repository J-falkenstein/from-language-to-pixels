"""The capital letter D is an uppercase letter that resembles a backward-facing open half-circle. The shape starts with a straight vertical line on the left side, then curves smoothly to the right, forming a semi-oval shape. The curved part of the D is open towards the left, leaving a clear space within the shape. The top of the open half-circle aligns horizontally with the bottom of the straight vertical line, creating a cohesive and balanced appearance. The proportions of the D are such that the height of the vertical line is roughly equal to the width of the curved part. The overall shape of the D is distinct and easily recognizable, with its characteristic curved form."""
