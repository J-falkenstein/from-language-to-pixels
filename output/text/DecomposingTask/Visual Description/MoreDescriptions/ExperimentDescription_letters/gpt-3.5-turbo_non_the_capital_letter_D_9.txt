"""The capital letter D is shaped like a semi-circle. The shape starts with a straight vertical line that curves smoothly to the right, forming the rounded part of the semi-circle. The top of the curved part aligns with the top of the vertical line, creating a seamless transition. The bottom of the curved part touches the base of the vertical line, forming a closed shape. The overall proportions of the D are such that the curved part is larger and wider than the vertical line. The curved part is smooth and has no sharp edges or corners. The D can be thought of as resembling the shape of a bowl, with the vertical line serving as the stem or handle."""
