"""The capital letter E is composed of three vertical parallel lines. The middle line is the longest, extending from the top to the bottom, while the other two lines are half the length of the middle line. The top and bottom lines are aligned with the ends of the middle line, creating a symmetrical appearance. The top and bottom lines have horizontal bars that extend outward on the right side, perpendicular to the vertical lines. These horizontal bars are slightly shorter than the length of the vertical lines and are aligned at the same height as the middle line. The ends of the horizontal bars are rounded, mimicking a small curve inwards. The vertical lines are evenly spaced apart, and the overall shape of the letter E forms a tall rectangle."""
