The capital letter E is composed of three vertical lines of equal length. The middle line is the longest, extending from the top to the bottom. On either side of the middle line are two shorter vertical lines, parallel to each other and aligned with the middle line. These shorter lines are positioned symmetrically, equidistant from the middle line, creating an evenly spaced and balanced appearance. The top of each vertical line is flat and horizontal, forming a straight edge across the top of the E. The bottom of each vertical line is also flat and horizontal, creating a consistent base for the letter. The overall shape of the E is rectangular, with the vertical lines forming the sides of the rectangle. The proportions of the letter are such that the height of the E is roughly equal to the width of the E, resulting in a square-like shape.
