"""The capital letter E is composed of three vertical lines that are connected by two horizontal lines. The middle vertical line is the longest, extending from the top of the letter to the bottom. It is flanked by two shorter vertical lines on either side. The top and bottom horizontal lines connect the three vertical lines, with the top line being slightly shorter than the bottom line. The vertical lines are evenly spaced, with the two outer lines aligning with the ends of the top and bottom horizontal lines."""
