"The capital letter E is formed by three vertical lines of equal length, with two horizontal lines that connect these vertical lines. The two horizontal lines are positioned parallel to each other, one near the top and the other near the bottom. The middle vertical line is slightly longer than the other two, extending below the bottom horizontal line. The three vertical lines are evenly spaced and aligned vertically. The overall shape of the letter E is rectangular, with straight lines and right angles."
