"The capital letter E is formed by three vertical lines of equal length. The middle line is slightly longer than the other two and is positioned in the center. The two outer lines are aligned with each other, forming a clear vertical symmetry. At the top and bottom of each vertical line, there is a horizontal line that connects them, creating a rectangular shape. These horizontal lines are slightly shorter than the vertical lines. Overall, the letter E has a tall and narrow appearance with straight lines and right angles."
