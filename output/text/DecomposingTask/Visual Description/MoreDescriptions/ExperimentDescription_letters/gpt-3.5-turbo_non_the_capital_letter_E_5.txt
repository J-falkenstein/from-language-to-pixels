"""The capital letter E is made up of three vertical lines of equal length, aligned side by side with equal spacing between them. The middle line is slightly longer than the other two and extends past their top and bottom ends. The top and bottom lines are parallel to each other, while the middle line is slightly inclined outward from the center, forming a triangular shape. The spacing between the lines creates an open space within each line and between them."""
