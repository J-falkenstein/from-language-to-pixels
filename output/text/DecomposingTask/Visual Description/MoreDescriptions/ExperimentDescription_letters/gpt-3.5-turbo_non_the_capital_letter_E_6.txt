"The capital letter E is composed of three vertical lines of equal length, aligned side by side with a small amount of space between each line. The outer lines are straight and parallel, while the inner line is offset slightly towards the right. The top and bottom lines are horizontal, extending beyond the outer vertical lines on both ends. The middle line is shorter, reaching only to the middle of the overall height of the letter. The overall shape appears to be a symmetric, rectangle-like form with the top and bottom lines acting as extended arms."
