"""The capital letter E is composed of three vertical, parallel lines of equal length. The two outer lines are aligned with each other and are slightly longer than the middle line. At the top and bottom of the vertical lines, there are two horizontal lines that connect them. The top horizontal line is shorter than the bottom one, creating a distinct asymmetry. The middle vertical line is positioned centrally between the two outer lines. All the lines are straight and form right angles where they intersect."""
