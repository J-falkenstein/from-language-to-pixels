The capital letter E is composed of three vertical lines. The middle line is the longest and extends from the top to the bottom of the letter. It is flanked on each side by two shorter, parallel vertical lines that are aligned with each other and slightly shorter than the middle line. The top ends of the shorter lines touch the top of the middle line. The bottom ends of the shorter lines are aligned with the bottom of the middle line. The letter E is symmetrical, with the shorter lines mirroring each other and aligning with the middle line.
