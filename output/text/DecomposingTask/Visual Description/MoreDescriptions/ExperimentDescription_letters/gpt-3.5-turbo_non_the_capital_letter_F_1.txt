"""The capital letter F is formed by one vertical line placed centrally, reaching from the top to the bottom of the writing area. There are two horizontal lines, one positioned at the top and one at the middle of the vertical line, perpendicular to it. The top horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line, extending only to the right side. The middle horizontal line is longer than the top line, extending to both the right and left sides, creating a crossbar in the middle of the vertical line. Both horizontal lines are aligned directly with the vertical line, creating a clean and symmetrical shape."""
