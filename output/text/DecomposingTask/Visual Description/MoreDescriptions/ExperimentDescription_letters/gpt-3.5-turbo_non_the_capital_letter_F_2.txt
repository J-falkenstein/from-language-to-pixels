"""The capital letter F is composed of three distinct vertical lines. The middle line is the longest and serves as the main stem of the letter. It is straight and runs from the top to the bottom of the letter, standing upright. On the left side of the stem, slightly above the middle, there is a shorter horizontal line that extends to the right. This line is parallel to the top and bottom of the letter and is positioned slightly higher than halfway up the stem. On the right side of the stem, slightly below the middle, there is another shorter horizontal line that extends to the right. This line is also parallel to the top and bottom of the letter, but it is positioned slightly lower than halfway down the stem. These two shorter lines are aligned with each other and the stem, forming a symmetrical and balanced appearance for the letter F."""
