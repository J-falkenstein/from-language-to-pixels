"""The capital letter F is composed of three distinct vertical elements. The leftmost element is a straight vertical line that extends from the top to the bottom. The middle element is a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line at its midpoint, extending to the right. The rightmost element is another straight vertical line that is slightly shorter and intersects the horizontal line near its top, forming a right angle."""
