"""The capital letter F is comprised of three distinct elements. Starting at the top, there is a horizontal line that extends from the left side to the right side, positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical space. Beneath this horizontal line, there is a shorter vertical line that extends downward from the midpoint of the horizontal line, stopping just above the baseline. This vertical line is aligned with the right side of the horizontal line. Finally, starting at the base of the vertical line, there is another horizontal line that extends to the right side, parallel to the top horizontal line. This lower horizontal line is longer than the top horizontal line and is positioned slightly below the midpoint of the vertical space. The three elements of the letter F are all straight lines, and each line retains a consistent width throughout. The vertical line is aligned with the right side of the top horizontal line, while the bottom horizontal line is aligned with the left side of the vertical line. The letter F is situated within a rectangular space, with the top and bottom horizontal lines aligned with the top and bottom edges of the rectangle, respectively."""
