"""The capital letter F is composed of three distinct vertical elements. The first element is a straight vertical line that extends from the top to the bottom, slightly taller than the rest of the letter. The second element is a shorter horizontal line that starts from the top left of the vertical line, intersects it slightly above the midpoint, and extends to the right. The third element is another vertical line that starts from the bottom of the first vertical line, curves slightly outward towards the right, and ends just below the horizontal line. The proportions of each element are such that the horizontal line is shorter than the vertical lines, and the second vertical line is shorter than the first. The first and third vertical lines are parallel to each other and aligned vertically."""
