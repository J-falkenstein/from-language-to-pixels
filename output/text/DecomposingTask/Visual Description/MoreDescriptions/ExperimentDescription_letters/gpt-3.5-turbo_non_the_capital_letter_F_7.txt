"The capital letter F is formed by three distinct vertical lines. The top line is longer and extends downward, while the two bottom lines are shorter and parallel to each other. The top and bottom lines are connected by a horizontal line that is slightly shorter than the top line. The top line is aligned with the leftmost point of the horizontal line, while the bottom lines are aligned with the rightmost point of the horizontal line. The overall shape of the F is tall and slim, with equal spacing between the vertical lines."
