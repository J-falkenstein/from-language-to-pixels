"The capital letter F is composed of three main elements. At the top, there is a horizontal line that is longer than the other lines. It extends from the left side to the right side, forming the top bar of the letter. Below this top bar, there is a vertical line that starts from the top and extends downward, almost reaching the bottom. This vertical line is aligned with the left side of the top bar. Lastly, there is another shorter horizontal line that connects the vertical line to the right side of the top bar, forming the bottom bar of the letter. The vertical line and the bottom bar are aligned with each other, creating a right angle in the bottom right corner of the letter. The proportions of the top bar and the vertical line are balanced, with the top bar being longer. The vertical line is centered within the width of the top bar, while the bottom bar is shorter and aligned with the right side of the top bar."
