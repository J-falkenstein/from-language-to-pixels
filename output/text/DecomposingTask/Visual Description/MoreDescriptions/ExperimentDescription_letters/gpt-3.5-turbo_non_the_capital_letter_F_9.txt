The capital letter F is composed of three straight lines. The main vertical line is positioned in the center, extending from the top to the bottom, and it is longer than the other two lines. At the top, the vertical line is intersected by a horizontal line that is slightly shorter, positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line. This horizontal line extends to the right and is parallel to the baseline of the letter. Towards the bottom of the vertical line, there is another horizontal line that extends to the right, parallel to the first horizontal line but positioned below it. This second horizontal line is shorter than the first one and slightly closer to the bottom of the vertical line. The three lines are straight, forming right angles where they intersect. The overall shape of the letter F is reminiscent of a tall rectangular structure with two horizontal bars extending from the sides of the upper portion.
