"""The capital letter G is comprised of two distinct elements. The upper part of the letter is a semi-circular shape that starts on the left side, curves upwards and then returns to the right, forming the top part of an oval. The lower part of the letter is a horizontal line that starts from the right side of the semi-circle and extends to the right. The line is positioned slightly below the center of the semi-circle, creating an open space between the two elements. The end of the line hooks downward in a rounded shape, mirroring the curve of the top part of the letter."""
