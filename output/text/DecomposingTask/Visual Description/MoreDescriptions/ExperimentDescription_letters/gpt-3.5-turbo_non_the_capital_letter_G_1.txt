"The capital letter G has a shape that resembles a backwards letter 'C' with a small loop at the open end. The main structure of the letter is formed by a large, curved arc that starts on the left side and curves smoothly to the right, forming the upper portion of the 'C' shape. The arc then descends diagonally to the left, forming a smaller, rounded loop that connects to the main arc. This loop is situated slightly above the midpoint of the main arc. The bottom portion of the letter is a straight vertical line that connects to the loop at a slight angle, extending downwards and ending just below the baseline. The straight line is positioned closer to the left side of the open loop than the right side, aligning with the overall diagonal right-leaning slant of the letter. Overall, the letter G has a distinctive curved structure with a small loop that distinguishes it from other letters."
