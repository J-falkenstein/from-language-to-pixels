"The capital letter G has a distinct shape that resembles a circle with a curved tail. The upper section of the letter is a semi-circular shape that curves downward and to the right. This semi-circular shape is disconnected from the lower section of the letter. The lower section consists of a vertical line that connects to the right side of the upper section and extends downward. At the bottom of the vertical line, there is a small horizontal line that curves to the left, creating a partially closed shape. This curved tail is positioned slightly to the right of the vertical line. The overall shape of the letter G is open and rounded, with the upper and lower sections appearing visually separate but connected."
