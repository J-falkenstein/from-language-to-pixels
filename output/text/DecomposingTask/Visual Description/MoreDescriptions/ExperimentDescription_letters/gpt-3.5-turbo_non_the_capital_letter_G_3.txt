"The capital letter G has a distinct shape that resembles a combination of a curve and a straight line. Starting from the upper left side, there is a horizontal line that extends to the right, and then curves downward in a smooth, rounded arc. The curve continues to the right, forming a closed loop that resembles a semicircle or a lowercase letter 'c'. Towards the bottom right, there is a small straight line that connects to the curve, creating a small tail. The overall shape of the G is asymmetrical, with the upper curve being larger and rounder than the lower curve. The alignment of the horizontal line is parallel to the baseline, while the curved section is positioned slightly above it. The proportions of the curves and straight lines create a balanced and recognizable shape for the letter G."
