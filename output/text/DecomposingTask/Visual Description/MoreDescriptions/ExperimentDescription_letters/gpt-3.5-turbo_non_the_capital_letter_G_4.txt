"""The capital letter G features a distinctive shape that can be described as a combination of two curved elements. The top part of the letter starts with a vertical straight line, positioned slightly to the left side. This line curves smoothly to the right, creating a semi-circular shape that extends downward. Near the midpoint of this curved line, there is a small horizontal line that juts outward to the right. This line is parallel to the initial vertical line and serves as a connection point for the bottom part of the letter. The bottom part resembles a tail that starts at the right end of the small horizontal line, curving back and upward to the left, forming an open loop that connects to the top curved element. The overall shape of the letter G is curvilinear, with a clear distinction between the upper and lower parts. The proportions are balanced, with the top curved element occupying more vertical space compared to the bottom tail. The alignment of the elements is such that the bottom tail is centered beneath the top curve, creating a harmonious and visually pleasing composition."""
