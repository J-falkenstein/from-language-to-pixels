"""The capital letter G is composed of two distinct parts. The top part resembles a backward facing 'C' or a half circle that starts on the left side and curves upward, then sharply turns to the right and extends downward. The bottom part is a curved horizontal line that connects to the right end of the top part and curves downward slightly. The bottom curve is parallel to the top curve and is positioned slightly below it. Overall, the letter G has a balanced and symmetrical appearance."""
