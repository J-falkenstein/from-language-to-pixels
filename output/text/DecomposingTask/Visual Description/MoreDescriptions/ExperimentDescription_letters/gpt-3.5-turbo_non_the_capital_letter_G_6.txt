"The capital letter G has two main components. The top portion of the letter resembles a semi-circle that starts on the left side and curves upwards and then to the right, forming a rounded shape. The bottom portion consists of a straight vertical line that starts at the bottom of the semi-circle and extends downwards. The line is aligned with the right side of the semi-circle and is slightly longer than the semi-circle. At the bottom of the vertical line, there is a small horizontal line that extends to the right, creating a curved shape that connects back to the vertical line. This small curved shape is parallel to the original semi-circle and is located slightly below its midpoint. Overall, the letter G has a distinctive rounded shape at the top, with a vertical line and a small curved shape at the bottom."
