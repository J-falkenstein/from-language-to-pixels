"""The capital letter G has a unique shape that includes both straight and curved elements. It is composed of a vertical line on the left side, which is slightly longer than the other vertical lines in the alphabet. At the top of the vertical line, there is a half-circle shape that curves towards the right, resembling the shape of a bowl or a backwards 'C'. From the bottom of this curve, a slightly slanted horizontal line extends to the right, then sharply curves downward. This curve connects to a vertical line that descends straight down, parallel to the initial vertical line on the left. At the very bottom of this second vertical line, there is a small hook or tail that extends slightly to the left, giving the letter G a distinctive appearance."""
