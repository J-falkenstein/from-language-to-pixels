"The capital letter G is composed of three distinct elements. At the top, there is a small semi-circular shape that curves downward and to the right. This shape connects to a vertical line that descends straight down from the bottom of the curve. Towards the bottom, the vertical line curves to the right in a smooth, gradual manner, forming a semi-circular shape that is open towards the right side. The top of the vertical line aligns with the top of the small semi-circular shape, while the bottom of the vertical line extends slightly below the curve of the bottom semi-circle."
