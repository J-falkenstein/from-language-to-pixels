The capital letter G has a distinct shape that includes both curved and straight elements. It starts with a semicircular shape at the top, resembling a flattened "C" turned on its side. This curved element begins on the left side, curves upwards, and then slightly curves back towards the right, ending in the middle. 

From the point where the curved element ends, a vertical straight line descends downwards, extending below the baseline. This line starts aligned with the right side of the curved element and remains parallel to it. The length of the vertical line is approximately two-thirds the height of the curved element.

At the bottom of the vertical line, it bends outward to the right, creating a small, horizontal, and open loop. This loop is located just slightly below the baseline and is aligned vertically with the top curved element. Its shape is similar to a small, lowercase "u", but with the ends slightly disconnected from the main line.

The shape of the capital letter G is generally symmetrical, with the top curved element and the loop at the bottom appearing as mirrored images of each other. The entire letter G is usually drawn with a consistent line thickness and has open space within the two curved elements and the loop.
