"""The capital letter H is a symmetrical shape with two vertical lines connected by a horizontal line. The vertical lines are identical in length and thickness, extending from the top to the bottom of the shape. The horizontal line is situated in the middle of the two vertical lines, connecting them at their midpoint. It is shorter in length compared to the vertical lines but has the same thickness. The vertical lines and the horizontal line are aligned vertically and horizontally, respectively, creating a visually balanced and centered composition. The spacing between the vertical lines and the horizontal line is equal, resulting in an evenly distributed shape. The H shape is open and empty inside, with no elements or curves intersecting its lines."""
