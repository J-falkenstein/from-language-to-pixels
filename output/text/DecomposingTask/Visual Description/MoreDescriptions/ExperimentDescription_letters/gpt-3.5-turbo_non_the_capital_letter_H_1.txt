The capital letter H is made up of two vertical lines that are parallel and of equal length. These two lines are connected by a horizontal line that is centered between them. The vertical lines extend from the top to the bottom, while the horizontal line cuts through the center. The vertical lines are straight and have no curves or bends. The horizontal line is also straight and does not slant or tilt. The proportions of the vertical lines are the same as the width of the horizontal line, resulting in a symmetrical appearance. The top and bottom of the vertical lines align horizontally with the ends of the horizontal line, creating a uniform and balanced structure.
