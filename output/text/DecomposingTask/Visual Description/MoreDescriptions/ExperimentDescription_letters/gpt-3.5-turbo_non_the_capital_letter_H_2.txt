"""The capital letter H is a symmetrical shape that consists of two parallel vertical lines connected by a horizontal line in the middle. The vertical lines are of equal length and are positioned at the left and right edges of the letter. The horizontal line is shorter in length and is centered between the vertical lines. It connects them at their midpoint, forming a cross-like shape. The vertical lines are straight and aligned with each other, while the horizontal line is also straight and aligned horizontally with the midpoints of the vertical lines. The proportions of the H are such that the vertical lines are much longer than the horizontal line, creating a distinctive tall and narrow shape."""
