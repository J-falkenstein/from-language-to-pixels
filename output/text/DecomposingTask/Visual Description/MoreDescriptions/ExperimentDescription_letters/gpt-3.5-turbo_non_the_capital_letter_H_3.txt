"The capital letter H is formed by two vertical parallel lines that are connected by a horizontal line placed in the center. The vertical lines are of equal length and extend from the top to the bottom of the letter. The horizontal line is shorter than the vertical lines and sits directly in the middle, joining them together. The top and bottom edges of the horizontal line align perfectly with the top and bottom edges of the vertical lines."
