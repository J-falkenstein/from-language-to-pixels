"The capital letter H is composed of two vertical lines that are parallel to each other and of equal length. These vertical lines are connected by a horizontal line that is positioned in the middle, bisecting the vertical lines. The horizontal line is shorter in length than the vertical lines, with its endpoints touching each vertical line. The vertical lines extend above and below the horizontal line by approximately the same distance."
