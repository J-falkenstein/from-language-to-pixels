"The capital letter H is composed of two vertical lines of equal length, with a horizontal line connecting them in the middle. The top and bottom vertical lines are parallel, extending straight up and down. The horizontal line is aligned with their midpoint, connecting them in a straight, horizontal orientation. The vertical lines are slightly longer than the horizontal line, creating equal spacing above and below the horizontal line."
