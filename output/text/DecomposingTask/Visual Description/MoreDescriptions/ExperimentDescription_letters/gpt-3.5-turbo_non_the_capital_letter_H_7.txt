"The capital letter H is composed of two vertical, parallel lines that are equidistant from each other and aligned in a straight vertical orientation. These two lines are connected by a horizontal line that is positioned in the center, intersecting the vertical lines at their midpoints. The vertical lines extend from the top to the bottom, while the horizontal line spans the width of the two vertical lines. The proportion of the vertical lines to the horizontal line is such that the vertical lines are longer, extending slightly above and below the horizontal line. The overall shape of the letter H is symmetrical, with each vertical line mirroring the other."
