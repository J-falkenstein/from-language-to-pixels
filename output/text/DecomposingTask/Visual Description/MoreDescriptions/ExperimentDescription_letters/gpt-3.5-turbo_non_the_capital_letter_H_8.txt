The capital letter H is made up of two vertical parallel lines with a horizontal line in the middle connecting them. The vertical lines are straight and equally spaced apart, extending from the top to the bottom of the letter. The horizontal line is shorter than the vertical lines, positioned exactly in the center and perpendicular to them. It connects the two vertical lines, crossing through them. The top and bottom edges of the horizontal line align with the corresponding edges of the vertical lines, creating a symmetrical and balanced structure. The H is characterized by its distinct and recognizable shape, with the vertical lines acting as the main supports and the horizontal line serving as a connector between them.
