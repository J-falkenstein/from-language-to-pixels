"The capital letter H is composed of two parallel vertical lines, evenly spaced and aligned vertically. The lines are of equal length, starting from the same point at the top and extending downwards. Connecting these two vertical lines is a shorter horizontal line, positioned exactly halfway between the two vertical lines. The horizontal line is perpendicular to the vertical lines and is centered between them, creating a symmetrical appearance. The vertical lines extend slightly below the horizontal line, giving the impression of legs or stems. Overall, the letter H has a box-like shape, with the vertical lines forming the sides and the horizontal line acting as the top of the box."
