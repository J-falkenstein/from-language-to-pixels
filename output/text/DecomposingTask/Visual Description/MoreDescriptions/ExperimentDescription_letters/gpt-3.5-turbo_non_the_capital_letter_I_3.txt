"The capital letter I is a tall and slender shape that consists of a vertical line. The line is straight and uniform in width from top to bottom. It stands upright and extends from the baseline, the imaginary line where the text rests, to the capline, the upper boundary of most lowercase letters. The line is centered within these boundaries, maintaining equal space on both sides. There are no additional elements or curves present in this letter, making it a simple and minimalistic shape."
