The capital letter I is a simple, vertical pillar-like shape. It consists of a straight, vertical line that is aligned perfectly upright. The line is typically longer than other letters, extending from the top to the bottom of the writing space. The width of the line is consistent throughout, creating a uniform and symmetrical appearance. The line does not intersect with any other lines or shapes. It stands alone, commanding attention and presence.
