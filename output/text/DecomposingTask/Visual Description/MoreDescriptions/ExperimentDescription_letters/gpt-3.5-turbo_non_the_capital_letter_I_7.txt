"""The capital letter 'I' is a tall and narrow shape that consists of one vertical line, centered within the space. The line extends from the top to the bottom, with equal length on both ends. The line is straight and parallel to the edges of the paper, forming a perfectly vertical alignment. The proportion of the vertical line is longer than it is wide, resembling the shape of a ruler or a tall pole."""
