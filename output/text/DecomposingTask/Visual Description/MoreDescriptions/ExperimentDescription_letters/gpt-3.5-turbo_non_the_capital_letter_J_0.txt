"The capital letter J has a straight vertical line as its main feature, slightly slanted to the right. At the top of this line, there is a small, curved hook that extends to the right. The hook begins at the top left of the vertical line and gently curves downward, ending in a rounded point. The vertical line below the hook is longer and continues straight down. The proportions of the letter J give it a tall and slender appearance, with the hook taking up about a third of the height of the overall letter. The hook is aligned with the right edge of the vertical line, creating a cohesive and flowing shape."
