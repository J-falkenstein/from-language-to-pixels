"""The capital letter J is composed of a long, vertical line on the left side that curves inward at the top. The top curve is similar to the shape of a fishhook or the end of a cane. The vertical line forms a right angle with the curved top, creating a distinctive hook shape. The hook is approximately one-third the height of the vertical line, with the top curve extending slightly to the left of the vertical line. The bottom of the vertical line is aligned with the bottom of the hook shape."""
