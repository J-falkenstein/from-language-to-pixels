"The capital letter J is formed by a vertical straight line that extends downwards from the top, curving gently to the right at the bottom. The top of the line is aligned with the left side of the letter, while the bottom curves slightly away from the left side. The curve at the bottom resembles the shape of a lowercase letter 'c', but larger. The line and the curve do not intersect, with a small space between them."
