"The capital letter J has a long vertical line on the left side that starts at the top and extends downward. At the top of the vertical line, there is a curved hook that extends to the right. The hook starts slightly below the top of the vertical line and curves smoothly to the right, resembling a backward C shape. The bottom of the hook aligns with the bottom of the vertical line, forming a seamless connection. The overall shape of the letter J is elongated and slightly slanted to the right."
