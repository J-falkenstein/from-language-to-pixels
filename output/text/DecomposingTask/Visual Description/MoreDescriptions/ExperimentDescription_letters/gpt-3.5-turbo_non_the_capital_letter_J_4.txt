"""The capital letter J is formed by a long vertical line that starts at the top left corner and extends downwards to the bottom, curving slightly to the right at the end. At the top of the vertical line, there is a short horizontal line that connects to the right side of the vertical line, creating a hook shape. The hook curves smoothly, resembling the shape of a fishhook or a lowercase letter 'j'."""
