"""The capital letter J consists of a long vertical line that starts at the top and extends downwards, curving to the right at the bottom. The top of the vertical line is aligned with the left side of a smaller horizontal line that extends to the right, forming the curved bottom of the J shape. The horizontal line is slightly shorter than the vertical line, and they meet at a smooth, rounded junction. The J shape has a sense of elegance and movement, with the curves flowing gracefully into each other."""
