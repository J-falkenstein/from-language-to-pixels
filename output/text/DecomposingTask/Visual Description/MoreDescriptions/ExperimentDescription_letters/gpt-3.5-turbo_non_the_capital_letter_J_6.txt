"""The capital letter J is formed by a vertical line that starts at the top and curves gracefully to the right, resembling a hook. The top of the vertical line is aligned with the left side of a small, semi-circular shape that extends to the right. The curve of the semi-circle is smooth and connects seamlessly with the vertical line. The overall shape of the J is tall and slender, with the semi-circle sitting on the right side of the vertical line."""
