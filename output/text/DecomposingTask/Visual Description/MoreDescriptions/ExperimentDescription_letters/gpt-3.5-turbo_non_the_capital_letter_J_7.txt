"""The capital letter J is composed of a long, vertical line that starts at the top and extends downward. At the bottom of the vertical line, there is a curved hook that extends to the right. The hook starts slightly below the top of the vertical line and forms a rounded shape, curving smoothly to the right before ending in a point. The vertical line and the hook are aligned with each other, forming a continuous, flowing shape."""
