"The capital letter J has a long vertical line on the left side that starts at the top and extends down to a point slightly below the baseline. At the top of the vertical line, there is a small horizontal hook that extends to the right. The hook is open on the left side, creating a distinctive curved shape. The vertical line and the hook are aligned in a straight vertical orientation, with the hook positioned slightly to the right of the midpoint of the vertical line. The overall shape of the letter J is similar to a cane or walking stick."
