"The capital letter K has three distinct straight lines. The first line starts from the top left corner and descends diagonally to the bottom right corner, forming an acute angle with the vertical. The second line starts from the top left corner and descends vertically to the bottom, parallel to the left side of the first line. The third line starts from the bottom right corner of the first line, slightly curving outward to the right and then vertically ascending to meet the second line at a point slightly below the top. The second line is longer than the other two lines, creating a triangular shape within the letter. The bottom portion of the diagonal line aligns with the top left corner of the vertical line, while the top of the diagonal line slightly protrudes above the top line."
