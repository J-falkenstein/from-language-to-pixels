"The capital letter K has a distinctive angular shape. It starts with a vertical line on the left side that extends downward. At the bottom, the line bends sharply to the right at a 90-degree angle. From this bend, a diagonal line slants upwards and to the right at a similar angle. This diagonal line stops short of reaching the same height as the vertical line, creating an open, triangular space between them. Continuing from the end of the diagonal line, another vertical line extends downward parallel to the first one. At the bottom, it bends sharply to the right at the same 90-degree angle as the first bend. These two vertical lines are aligned and parallel, creating a symmetrical shape. The diagonal line and the two vertical lines are all interconnected and form a distinctive 'V' or 'A' shape at the top."
