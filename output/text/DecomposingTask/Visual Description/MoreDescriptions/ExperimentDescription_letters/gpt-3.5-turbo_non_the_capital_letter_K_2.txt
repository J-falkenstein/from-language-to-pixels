"""The capital letter K is composed of four distinct line segments. It starts with a vertical line that is straight and aligned in the middle. From the top of this vertical line, a diagonal line emerges, slanting to the right at a 45-degree angle. The diagonal line intersects with the vertical line at its midway point. From the bottom of the vertical line, another diagonal line extends, this time slanting to the left at a 45-degree angle. This diagonal line also intersects with the vertical line at its midway point. Finally, at the top of the diagonal lines, a horizontal line connects them together, creating an inverted 'V' shape. The diagonal lines are slightly longer than the vertical line, and all four lines are equally spaced apart."""
