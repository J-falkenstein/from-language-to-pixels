"""The capital letter K is formed by two diagonal lines and one vertical line. The diagonal lines are slanted towards each other, starting from the top left and top right corners respectively, and intersecting at a point slightly below the middle. The vertical line connects to the bottom point of intersection and extends downwards, creating a right angle with the diagonal lines. The diagonal lines are equal in length and the vertical line is slightly shorter than the diagonal lines. The overall shape of the letter K resembles a triangle with a shorter line sticking out from the bottom."""
