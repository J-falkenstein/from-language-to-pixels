"""The capital letter K is composed of three distinct straight lines. The central line is vertical and extends from the top to the bottom, serving as the backbone of the letter. At the top of the central line, two diagonal lines branch off in opposite directions. These lines are slanted towards each other, meeting just above the midpoint of the central line. They create a V-shaped notch in the upper portion of the letter. The length of the diagonal lines is shorter than the central line, resulting in the letter K's distinctive shape."""
