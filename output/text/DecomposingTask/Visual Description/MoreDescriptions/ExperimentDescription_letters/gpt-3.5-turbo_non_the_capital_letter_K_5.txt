"The capital letter K is formed by three distinct lines. The first line is a vertical line that starts at the top left corner and extends downwards. The second line is a diagonal line that starts at the top right corner and slants downwards to the left, intersecting with the first line at a point slightly above the middle. The third line is a diagonal line that starts at the intersection point of the first two lines and slants downwards to the right, forming an angle with the second line. The third line is shorter than the first two lines, creating an open space between the top and bottom parts of the letter. The overall shape of the letter K is similar to an upside-down 'V' with a vertical line attached to the bottom point of the 'V'."
