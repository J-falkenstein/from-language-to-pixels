"""The capital letter K is composed of three distinct straight lines. The vertical line is positioned in the middle and extends from the top to the bottom of the character. On the left side of the vertical line, there is a diagonal line that starts at the top left corner and slants downwards towards the right, stopping just above the middle of the vertical line. On the right side of the vertical line, there is another diagonal line that starts at the top right corner and slants downwards towards the left, stopping just below the middle of the vertical line. The two diagonal lines are symmetrical and form an angle with the vertical line, creating a distinctive letter K shape."""
