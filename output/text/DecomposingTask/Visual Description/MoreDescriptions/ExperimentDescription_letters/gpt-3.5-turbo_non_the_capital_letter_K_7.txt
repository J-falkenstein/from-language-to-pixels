"The capital letter K is made up of three distinct diagonal lines. The first diagonal line starts at the top left corner and slopes downwards to the right, making an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the vertical. The second diagonal line starts at the top right corner and slopes downwards to the left, also making an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the vertical. These two diagonal lines intersect at a point near the middle of the letter. The third diagonal line connects the intersection point of the first two lines to the bottom left corner, sloping upwards to the right at an angle of approximately 30 degrees with the horizontal. The letter K has a balanced, symmetrical appearance, with the three diagonal lines aligned in a visually pleasing arrangement."
