"""The capital letter K is composed of three distinct elements. It starts with a vertical line that is aligned in the center. From the top of this vertical line, two diagonal lines extend outward and upward, forming acute angles with the vertical line. These diagonal lines are of equal length and converge at a point towards the top. The top of the vertical line serves as the baseline for the diagonal lines, which are slanted towards the left. The diagonal lines are symmetrical in relation to the vertical line, creating a distinctive "V" shape at the top."""
