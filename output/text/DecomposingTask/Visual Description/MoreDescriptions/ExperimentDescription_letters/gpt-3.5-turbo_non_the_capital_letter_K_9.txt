"The capital letter K has a vertical line on the left side, starting at the top and extending downward. About two-thirds of the way down, there is a diagonal line that is slightly shorter than the vertical line. The diagonal line slants from the top-right to the bottom-left, forming an acute angle with the vertical line. At the bottom, there is a horizontal line that connects the bottom ends of both the vertical and diagonal lines. The horizontal line is parallel to the top of the letter and is slightly shorter than the vertical line. The letter K has a symmetrical structure, with the diagonal line dividing the vertical line into two equal segments."
