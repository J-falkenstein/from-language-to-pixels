"The capital letter L is composed of two line segments. The first segment is a vertical line that starts at the top and extends straight down to the bottom. The second segment is a horizontal line that starts at the bottom of the vertical line, extending to the right. The horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line, and its right end aligns with the bottom end of the vertical line at a right angle. The two lines intersect at the bottom end of the vertical line, creating a right angle where they meet."
