The capital letter L is a straight vertical line that is perpendicular to a horizontal line. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line and is positioned on the left side of the horizontal line. The two lines meet at a right angle, with the vertical line extending upwards and the horizontal line extending to the right. The vertical line is parallel to the left edge of the drawing surface, while the horizontal line is parallel to the bottom edge. The L shape is open and does not have any curves or rounded corners.
