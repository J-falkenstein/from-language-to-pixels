"""The capital letter L is a simple and straight shape that consists of two perpendicular lines. The vertical line is longer and starts at the top, extending downwards to the bottom. The horizontal line connects to the vertical line at its midpoint, protruding to the right. The horizontal line is shorter, creating a right angle with the vertical line. The two lines intersect at their endpoints, forming a sharp corner."""
