The capital letter L is comprised of one long vertical line positioned on the left side, and one shorter horizontal line attached to the bottom end of the vertical line, extending towards the right. The vertical line is the main element, starting at the top and continuing straight down. The horizontal line is perpendicular to the vertical line, connecting to it at the lowest point of the vertical line's length. The horizontal line extends to the right, creating a right angle with the vertical line. The two lines intersect at the bottom left corner of the L shape.
