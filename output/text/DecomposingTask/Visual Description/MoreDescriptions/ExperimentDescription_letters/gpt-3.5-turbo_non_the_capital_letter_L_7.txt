"""The capital letter L is formed by a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line extending from the bottom of the vertical line. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line and is perfectly straight, while the horizontal line is shorter and intersects the vertical line at a right angle, creating a 90-degree angle. The horizontal line is positioned slightly below the midpoint of the vertical line."""
