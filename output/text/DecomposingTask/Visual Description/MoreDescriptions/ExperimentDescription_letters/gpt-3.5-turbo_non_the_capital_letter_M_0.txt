"""The capital letter M has a distinctive shape, resembling two slanting lines that meet at a central point and then diverge at an equal angle. The top line starts from the left side at a slightly upwards slant, then travels diagonally towards the center, where it connects with the other line. The bottom line starts from the left side as well, but it slants downwards, meeting the center point at a lower level than the top line. Both lines continue from the center point, slanting upwards and outwards in a symmetrical manner, creating a V-shaped formation. The overall shape of the M is tall and narrow, with the slanting lines forming a sharp and angular appearance."""
