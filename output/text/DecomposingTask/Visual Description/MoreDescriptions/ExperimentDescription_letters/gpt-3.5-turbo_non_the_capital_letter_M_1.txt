The capital letter M is composed of three equally spaced vertical lines that are connected at the center. Starting from the top, the first line slants diagonally towards the right, then sharply angles downwards and to the left. The second line slants diagonally towards the right as well, but not as steeply as the first line. It then angles downwards and to the right, crossing underneath the first line. The third line is a mirror image of the first line, slanting diagonally towards the left, then sharply angling downwards and to the right. The vertical lines are aligned in a straight vertical orientation, and the overall shape of the M resembles two mountain peaks connected at the base. The horizontal distance between the vertical lines is consistent throughout, creating equal spacing between the lines.
