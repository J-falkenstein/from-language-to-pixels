"The capital letter M is formed by two diagonal lines that meet in the center to create a sharp inverted V-shape. Each diagonal line starts at the bottom and slants upwards towards the center, forming a symmetrical appearance. The top of the letter has a horizontal line connecting the two diagonal lines, creating a distinct peak. The vertical alignment of the two diagonal lines and the horizontal line gives the letter M a balanced and structured look."
