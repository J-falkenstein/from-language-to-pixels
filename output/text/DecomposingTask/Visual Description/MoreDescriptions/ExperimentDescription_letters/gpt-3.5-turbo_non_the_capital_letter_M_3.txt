"""The capital letter M is formed by three straight lines. Two lines start from a common point at the bottom, slanting outward to the left and right respectively, and then curve upwards to create two peaks. The middle line starts from the same common point at the bottom, rises vertically and then curves downwards to meet the two slanting lines at their midpoints. The resulting shape resembles a series of mountain peaks connected by valleys."""
