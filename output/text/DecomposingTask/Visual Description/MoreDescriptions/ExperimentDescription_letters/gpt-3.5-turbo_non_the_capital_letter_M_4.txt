"""The capital letter M is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect in the middle. The lines start at the top, slanting downward and outward to the sides, before curving back inwards and meeting at a sharp point in the center. The angle of each line is approximately 45 degrees. The space between the two lines forms a V shape, with the open part facing downwards."""
