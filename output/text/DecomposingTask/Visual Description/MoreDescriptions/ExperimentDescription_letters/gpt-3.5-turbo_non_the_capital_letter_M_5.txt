"The capital letter M is formed by three diagonal lines that intersect at specific points. Starting from the top, the first diagonal line slopes down to the right at a slight angle. It is followed by a second diagonal line that slopes down to the left, intersecting with the first line at a point slightly lower than its starting point. The third diagonal line then slopes down to the right, starting from the same point as the second line's endpoint and mirroring the angle of the first line. The three lines create a distinct triangular shape, with the middle line being the longest. The proportions of the lines are such that the middle line is typically the tallest, while the other two lines are slightly shorter. The intersections between the lines are aligned vertically, creating a symmetrical arrangement. The overall shape of the letter M is visually distinctive and easily recognizable."
