"The capital letter M is formed by two diagonal lines that slant inwards towards each other, meeting at the center point. Each diagonal line starts from the bottom left and bottom right corners, then extends upwards and towards the center, forming a sharp peak in the middle. The distance between the two diagonal lines gradually widens as they move away from the center, creating a distinct 'V' shape. The overall shape of the letter M resembles an upside-down mountain peak, with the two diagonal lines acting as the slopes."
