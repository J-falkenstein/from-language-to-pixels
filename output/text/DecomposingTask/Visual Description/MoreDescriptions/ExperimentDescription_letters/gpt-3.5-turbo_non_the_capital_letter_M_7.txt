""The capital letter M is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect in the middle. The lines start from the bottom corners and converge towards the center, creating a "V" shape. From the intersection point, two diagonal lines extend outward and upward, forming the outer edges of the letter. These lines are symmetrical and ascend at an angle, curving gently towards each other near the top. The middle point where the lines intersect creates a distinct central peak, resembling a small mountain peak. The proportions of the letter are such that the outer edges extend slightly beyond the vertical height of the center point. The overall shape of the letter M is similar to an upside-down "V" with extended arms.""
