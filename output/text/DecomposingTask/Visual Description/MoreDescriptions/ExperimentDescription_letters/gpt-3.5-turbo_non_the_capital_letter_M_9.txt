The capital letter M is a symmetrical shape that consists of three upright lines. It starts with a vertical line in the middle, followed by two slanted lines that slope outward and away from each other. These slanted lines start from the base of the middle line, slanting upwards and outwards, and then curve back inwards at the top to form a point. The slanted lines are of equal length and symmetrical in relation to the middle line. Overall, the letter M has a distinct triangular shape with pointed ends and a central vertical line.
