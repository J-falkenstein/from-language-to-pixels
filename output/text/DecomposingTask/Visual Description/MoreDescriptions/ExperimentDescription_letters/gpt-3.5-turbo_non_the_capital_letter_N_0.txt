"The capital letter N is composed of three diagonal lines. The first line slants downwards and to the right, starting from the top left corner and ends near the bottom right corner. The second line slants upwards and to the right, starting from the bottom left corner and ends near the top right corner. These two lines are parallel and have the same length. The third line is vertical and forms the left side of the letter, connecting the top and bottom points of the first two diagonal lines. It is perpendicular to the slanted lines and is longer in length."
