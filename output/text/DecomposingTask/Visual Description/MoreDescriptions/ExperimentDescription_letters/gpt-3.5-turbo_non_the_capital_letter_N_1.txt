"The capital letter N is formed by two diagonal lines that meet at a central point, resembling a 'V' shape. The diagonal lines are slightly slanted towards each other, with the left line starting at the top and slanting down to the left, while the right line starts at the same top point and slants down to the right. The lines are of equal length and thickness. The bottom of the letter consists of a horizontal line that connects the two diagonal lines, forming a solid base. The top of the letter is open."
