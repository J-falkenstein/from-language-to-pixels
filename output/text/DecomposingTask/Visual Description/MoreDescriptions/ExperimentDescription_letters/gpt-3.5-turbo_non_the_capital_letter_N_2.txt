"The capital letter N has a distinct angular shape. It consists of two diagonal lines that intersect in the middle at a right angle. The top line starts from the left, slanting downward to the right, and ends slightly below the intersection point. The bottom line starts from the left as well, slanting upward to the right, and ends slightly above the intersection point. The angles of the lines are sharp and well-defined, forming a clear 'V' shape at the intersection point."
