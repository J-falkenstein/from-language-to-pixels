"""The capital letter N is made up of three diagonal lines. The top and bottom lines are longer and parallel to each other, forming the sides of the letter. The middle line connects the two side lines, slanting in the opposite direction. The top line starts at the upper left corner, moving diagonally downwards to the right. The middle line starts at the upper left corner as well, but it moves diagonally downwards to the left. Finally, the bottom line starts at the lower left corner, moving diagonally upwards to the right. The angles between the lines create a distinct shape that resembles the letter N."""
