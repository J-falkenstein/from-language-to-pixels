"""The capital letter N is comprised of three distinct diagonal lines. It begins with a vertical line that is slightly tilted to the right. At the top of this line, a diagonal line begins on the left side, slanting downwards and to the right. This line intersects with the vertical line, forming a sharp point. From this point, another diagonal line begins on the right side, slanting downwards and to the left. The second diagonal line intersects with the vertical line, creating a second sharp point. The proportions between the lines are equal, resulting in a symmetrical and balanced shape. The vertical line is longer than the diagonal lines, extending above and below them."""
