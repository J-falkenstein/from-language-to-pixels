"""The capital letter N is comprised of three straight, parallel lines. The two outer lines are vertical and of equal length, while the middle line is diagonal and shorter in length. The diagonal line starts at the top left and slopes downward toward the right, intersecting with the vertical lines at their midpoints. The vertical lines are aligned in a straight, upright position and are equidistant from each other."""
