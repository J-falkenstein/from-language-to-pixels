"The capital letter N is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a point in the middle. The first diagonal line slants from the top left to the bottom right, while the second diagonal line slants from the top right to the bottom left. The lines are equal in length and thickness. The point of intersection is located slightly below the center of the vertical alignment of the letter, creating an asymmetrical appearance. The top part of the letter, formed by the first diagonal line, is longer than the bottom part, formed by the second diagonal line."
