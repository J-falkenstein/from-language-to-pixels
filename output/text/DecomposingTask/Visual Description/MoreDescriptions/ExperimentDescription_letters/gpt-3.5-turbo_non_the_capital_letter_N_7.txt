"""The capital letter N is comprised of three straight lines. The first line starts at the top left corner and slants downwards to the right. The second line starts at the top right corner and slants downwards to the left, intersecting the first line at a slight angle. The third line starts at the bottom left corner and extends vertically, parallel to the first line, but slightly shorter. The three lines form a distinct 'V' shape in the center, with the vertical line positioned between the two slanted lines."""
