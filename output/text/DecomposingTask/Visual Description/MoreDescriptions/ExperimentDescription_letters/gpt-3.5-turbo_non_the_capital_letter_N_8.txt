"""The capital letter N is a tall and narrow shape with three distinct diagonal elements. It begins with a vertical line on the left, which is slightly longer than the other two diagonals. The first diagonal starts at the top left corner and slants downward to the right, ending at the midway point of the vertical line. The second diagonal starts at the bottom left corner and slants upward to the right, intersecting with the first diagonal at the midpoint. The third diagonal starts at the top right corner and slants downward to the right, ending at the bottom right corner. The three diagonals are evenly spaced and aligned, creating a symmetrical and angular shape."""
