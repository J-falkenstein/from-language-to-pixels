"""The capital letter N is composed of three straight lines that intersect at distinct points. The vertical line starts at the top left corner and extends downwards, ending slightly before the bottom. The first diagonal line starts at the top left corner and slopes towards the bottom right, intersecting the vertical line at its midpoint. The second diagonal line starts at the top right corner and slopes towards the bottom left, intersecting the vertical line slightly below the midpoint. The three lines form a distinct 'V' shape, with the two diagonals angling outwards from the vertical line."""
