"""The capital letter O is a perfectly round shape, resembling a circle. It has no straight lines or angles, just a smooth, continuous curve that forms a closed shape. The outer edge of the circle is the same thickness throughout, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The interior of the circle is typically empty, forming a clear and open space within the shape. The size of the circle can vary, but it is usually larger than other letters or numbers. The O is aligned in a straight, vertical orientation and does not intersect or overlap with any other elements."""
