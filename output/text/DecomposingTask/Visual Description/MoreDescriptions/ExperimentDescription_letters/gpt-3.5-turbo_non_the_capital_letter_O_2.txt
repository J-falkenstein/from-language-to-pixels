"""The letter O is a perfect circle, with no distinct features or irregularities. The circumference of the circle is smooth and continuous, forming an unbroken line. The circle is centrally aligned, meaning that its center point is equidistant from all points on its circumference. There are no other elements or alignments with other objects, as the O exists as an individual, self-contained shape."""
