"The capital letter O is a perfect circle shape. It is symmetrical, with a consistent width around its entire circumference. The circle is completely closed, with no gaps or openings. The edges of the circle are smooth and even, forming a continuous line. The size of the circle can vary, but it is typically larger than other letters or symbols. The O is aligned in a straight vertical or horizontal orientation, depending on its position within a word or sentence. The interior of the circle is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the shape."
