"The capital letter O is a perfect circle. It has a smooth, rounded shape with no corners or angles. The circle is symmetrical and has an equal diameter all the way around. The edges of the circle are continuous and form a complete loop. The interior of the circle is typically empty, creating a clear, open space within the shape."
