"""The capital letter O is a perfectly symmetrical shape that resembles a circle. It is comprised of a continuous curved line that starts at the top left, curves smoothly downward and to the right, forming a rounded bottom, and then curves upward and to the left, completing the circle. The shape is even and smooth throughout, with no sharp angles or corners. The size of the circle remains consistent from top to bottom, creating a sense of balance and harmony. The interior of the circle is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the shape."""
