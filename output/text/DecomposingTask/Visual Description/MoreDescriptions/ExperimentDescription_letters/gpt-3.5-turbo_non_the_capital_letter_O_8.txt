"""The capital letter O is a perfectly round shape, resembling a complete circle. It has no distinct features or angles. The edges of the circle are smooth and evenly curved, creating a continuous, unbroken line. The size of the circle is consistent throughout, with no variations in width or thickness. The orientation of the O is vertical, with its top aligned with the bottom and its left side aligned with the right. The interior of the circle is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the shape."""
