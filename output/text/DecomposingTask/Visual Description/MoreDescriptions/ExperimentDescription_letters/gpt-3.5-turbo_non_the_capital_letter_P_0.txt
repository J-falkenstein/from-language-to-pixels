The capital letter P has a straight vertical stem that extends downward from the top to the bottom of the letter. At the top of the stem, there is a curved, semicircular shape attached on the right side. This curved part starts at the top of the stem, curves to the right, and then continues downward, ending just slightly below the middle of the stem. The stem and the curved part of the letter P are aligned vertically, with the curved part slightly to the right of the stem. The stem and the curve do not intersect or touch each other, but they are visually connected, forming the letter P. Both the stem and the curved part of the letter P have clear, distinct edges and smooth curves. The overall proportion of the letter P is such that the height of the stem is longer than the length of the curved part.
