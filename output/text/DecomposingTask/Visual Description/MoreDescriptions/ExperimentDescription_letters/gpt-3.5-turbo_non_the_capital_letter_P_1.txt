"The capital letter P is comprised of a vertical, straight line on the left side, which serves as the backbone of the letter. This line is slightly taller than it is wide and is positioned towards the left of the overall shape. At the top of the vertical line, there is a distinct, curved element that starts on the left side and curves downwards towards the bottom right. This curve is semicircular in shape and is open towards the right side of the letter, leaving a clear, empty space within the curve. The bottom of the vertical line is connected to a horizontal line, which is shorter in length compared to the vertical line. This horizontal line extends towards the right side of the letter, parallel to the baseline and positioned slightly above it. It is aligned with the bottom of the curve in a straight, horizontal orientation. The overall shape of the capital letter P is defined by these three distinct elements: the vertical line, the curved element at the top, and the horizontal line at the bottom."
