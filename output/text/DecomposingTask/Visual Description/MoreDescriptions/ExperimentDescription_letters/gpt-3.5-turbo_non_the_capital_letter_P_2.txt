"""The capital letter P is a vertical line that starts at the top left corner and extends down to the bottom right corner. About two-thirds of the way down the line, a horizontal line extends out to the right, parallel to the baseline. This horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line, but longer than the width of the vertical line itself. The vertical line and the horizontal line are connected at the right end, forming a right angle. The vertical line is straight and unbroken, while the horizontal line is also straight and unbroken. The overall shape of the letter P is tall and narrow, with the horizontal line serving as a protrusion from the right side of the vertical line."""
