"The capital letter P appears as a vertical straight line on the left side, slightly taller than the other elements. At the top of the vertical line, there is a horizontal curved line that extends to the right, curving downwards and then curving back upwards to connect with the vertical line. The curvature of the horizontal line is gentle and smooth, forming a semi-circular shape. The vertical line and the semi-circle are aligned, with the semi-circle positioned slightly to the right of the top of the vertical line."""
