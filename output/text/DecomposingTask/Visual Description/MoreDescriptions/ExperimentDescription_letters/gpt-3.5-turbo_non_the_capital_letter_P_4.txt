"The capital letter P is formed by a vertical line on the left side and a curved line that starts at the top left corner of the vertical line, curves to the right, and then ends horizontally. The vertical line is slightly longer than the curved line, which gives the letter its distinct shape. The top of the vertical line is aligned with the top of the curved line, creating a sharp angle where the two lines meet. The bottom of the vertical line extends slightly below the curved line, forming a small gap between the two lines. The overall shape of the letter P can be described as a vertical line with a curved 'hook' attached to the top right corner."
