"The capital letter P is formed by a vertical straight line on the left side, which is slightly longer than the other elements. At the top of this line, there is a rounded curve that extends to the right side in a clockwise direction. This curve is similar to a half circle but with a flattened bottom. From the bottom of the curve, a short horizontal line extends to the right, parallel to the top curve. This line is slightly lower than the top curve, creating a noticeable gap between the two. Overall, the letter P has a tall and slender appearance, with the majority of its elements positioned on the left side."
