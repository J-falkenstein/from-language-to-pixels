"The capital letter P is composed of a vertical line connected to a half-circle. The vertical line is straight and extends downward from the top, positioned slightly to the right. It is proportional in length to the height of the half-circle. The half-circle starts from the top of the vertical line, curves smoothly to the right, and ends towards the bottom, closely resembling a backward letter 'C'. The bottom of the half-circle aligns with the bottom end of the vertical line, forming a closed shape."
