"""The capital letter P is composed of a vertical line that starts at the top and extends downward. This line is straight and evenly aligned in the center. At the bottom of the vertical line, a horizontal line juts out to the right, forming a flat line that is shorter than the vertical line. The horizontal line is parallel to the ground and connects to the vertical line at a right angle. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, giving the overall shape of the letter P a tall and slender appearance."""
