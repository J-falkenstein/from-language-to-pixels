"""The capital letter P is comprised of three main elements. It starts with a vertical straight line on the left side, slightly taller than half the height of the overall letter. At the top of this line, there is a curved semicircle that opens to the right. The curve connects smoothly to a horizontal line that extends to the right, just below the top of the vertical line. The horizontal line ends in a vertical downward stroke, parallel to the first vertical line, creating a closed loop at the bottom of the letter."""
