"""The capital letter P has a vertical line on the left side that starts at the top and extends downward. At the top of the vertical line, there is a horizontal line that extends to the right. The horizontal line is connected to the vertical line at a right angle, forming a 90-degree angle. The bottom portion of the vertical line curves to the right, resembling a half-circle shape. The curved portion is connected to the vertical line at its midpoint, creating a smooth, continuous curve from the top to the bottom. The overall shape of the letter P is tall and narrow, with the curvature on the bottom giving it a distinct and recognizable appearance."""
