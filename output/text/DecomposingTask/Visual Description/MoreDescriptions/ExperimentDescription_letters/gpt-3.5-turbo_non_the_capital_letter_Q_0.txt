"""The capital letter Q is composed of a large circle with a smaller circle attached to its lower right side. The larger circle is the dominant feature and forms the majority of the letter. It is perfectly round and positioned horizontally. The smaller circle, approximately half the size of the larger one, is located at the lower right quadrant of the larger circle. It is tangent to the larger circle, meaning it aligns perfectly at one point. The smaller circle is also round and its bottom section overlaps with the larger circle. This creates a unique and distinctive shape for the letter Q, resembling a lowercase letter 'o' attached to the bottom right of a larger 'O'."""
