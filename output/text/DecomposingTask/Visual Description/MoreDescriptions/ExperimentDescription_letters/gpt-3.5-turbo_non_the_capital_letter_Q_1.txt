"""The capital letter Q is formed by a circle at the bottom, which is connected to a straight vertical line extending upwards from the right side of the circle. The top of the vertical line is slightly curved towards the left, forming a small hook shape. At the top left of the circle, there is a small diagonal line that extends to the left and slightly upwards. This diagonal line intersects with the curved top of the vertical line, creating an open space within the letter Q."""
