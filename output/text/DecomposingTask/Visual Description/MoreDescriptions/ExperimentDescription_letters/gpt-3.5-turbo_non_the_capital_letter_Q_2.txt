"""The capital letter Q has a distinctive shape that resembles the number 2 merged with a small line. It begins with a vertical line on the left side, starting slightly above the baseline, extending downward and curving towards the right. At the bottom, it connects smoothly to a large semi-circle that encloses the entire right side of the letter. The semi-circle starts slightly higher than the baseline and curves to the right, meeting the vertical line at the bottom. The top of the semi-circle is at the same level as the top of the vertical line, creating a visually balanced shape. The interior of the semi-circle is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the letter Q."""
