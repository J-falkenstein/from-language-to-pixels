"The capital letter Q is comprised of a large oval shape that is open at the bottom. The oval is wider than it is tall and is positioned with its wider end on top. Inside the oval, there is a smaller circle that is connected to the oval on the right side, near the top. The circle is aligned horizontally and is slightly smaller than the width of the oval. The bottom of the oval curves inward to form a small tail that extends to the right, creating the open space at the bottom of the letter. Overall, the letter Q has a round and flowing shape, with the circular element inside adding a unique and distinctive feature."
