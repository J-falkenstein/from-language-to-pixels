"""The capital letter Q has a rounded, circular shape with a unique feature. It resembles an uppercase letter 'O' with a small tail or loop attached to the right side. The main circular shape is positioned towards the top of the letter, with the tail extending downward from the right side. The tail starts slightly above the center of the circular shape and curves to the right, forming a small loop at the end. The loop is positioned below the circular shape, creating a distinct and recognizable feature of the letter Q. The proportions are such that the circular shape is larger than the looped tail, and both elements are aligned vertically."""
