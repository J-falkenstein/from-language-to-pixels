"""The capital letter Q consists of a large circle that forms the main body of the letter. The circle is closed, with no openings or breaks. At the bottom right of the circle, a smaller semi-circle is attached, forming the tail of the letter. The tail starts at the bottom of the circle, curves outward, and then curves back towards the main body of the letter, connecting at the top right of the circle. The main body of the letter is slightly taller than it is wide, and the tail extends below the baseline, giving the letter a downward orientation. The overall shape of the letter Q is rounded and flowing, with no sharp angles or corners."""
