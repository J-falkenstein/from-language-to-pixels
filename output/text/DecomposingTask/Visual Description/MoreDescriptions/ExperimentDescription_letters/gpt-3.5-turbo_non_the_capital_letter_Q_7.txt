The capital letter Q is shaped like a large circle with a small line extending from its right side. The circle is closed, meaning there is no opening or gap within it. The line extends outwards from the middle of the right side of the circle, curving slightly downwards and towards the right. The line is shorter than the diameter of the circle, leaving a gap between its end and the circle. It is aligned with the right side of the circle, appearing as if it continues the curve of the circle. The circle and the line are not intersecting or overlapping. The circle is the dominant feature of the letter, taking up the majority of the space and defining its overall shape.
