"""The capital letter Q has a rounded shape consisting of a large outer circle and a smaller inner circle that is tangent to the outer circle on the right side. The outer circle is slightly wider at the top and tapers towards the bottom. The bottom of the outer circle extends downward to form a long, curved tail that loops around and ends in a small horizontal line that connects back to the bottom right side of the outer circle. The inner circle is positioned towards the top left of the outer circle and is slightly smaller in size. It is aligned vertically and parallel to the outer circle, with a small gap between them. The interior of both circles is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within each circle."""
