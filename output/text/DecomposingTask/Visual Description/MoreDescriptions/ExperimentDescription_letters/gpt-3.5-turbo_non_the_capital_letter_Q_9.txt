"The capital letter Q features a circular shape with a distinct tail extending from the right side. The circular part is positioned at the top left, forming a smooth curve that descends to the bottom right. It is slightly taller than it is wide. The tail begins from the bottom right side of the circle, extending outwards and curving towards the right, resembling a semi-circle. The tail is roughly half the height of the circular part and points towards the right at a slight angle."
