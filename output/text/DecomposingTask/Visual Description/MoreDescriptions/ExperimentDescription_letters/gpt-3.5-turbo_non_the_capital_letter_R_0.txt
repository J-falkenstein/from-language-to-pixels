"The capital letter R has a distinctive shape that combines straight and curved lines. It starts with a vertical line on the left side, slightly slanted to the right. About halfway up the vertical line, there is a sharp turn to the right, forming a diagonal line that extends to the right and slightly upwards. At the end of the diagonal line, there is a small horizontal line that connects back to the vertical line, creating a closed loop. The closed loop is slightly rounded and positioned to the right of the vertical line, with its top end aligning with the top end of the diagonal line. The overall shape of the letter R is tall and narrow, with the diagonal line being longer than the vertical line. The closed loop is positioned to the right of the diagonal line, creating an asymmetrical appearance."
