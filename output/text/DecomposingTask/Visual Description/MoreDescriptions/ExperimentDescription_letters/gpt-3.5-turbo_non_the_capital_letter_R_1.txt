"""The capital letter R is formed by a vertical straight line on the left side that is slightly longer than average height. At the top-right end of the vertical line, a diagonal line extends to the right at a sharp angle, almost forming a 45-degree angle with the vertical line. This diagonal line is slightly shorter than the vertical line. From the end of the diagonal line, another diagonal line extends downwards towards the left, curving slightly before reaching the bottom. This bottom diagonal line is longer than the previous diagonal line, creating a distinct curved shape. The space enclosed by these lines is typically empty, forming an open area within the letter R. The vertical line is parallel to the left edge of the paper or surface on which the drawing is being made, while the diagonal lines are aligned at specific angles relative to the vertical line."""
