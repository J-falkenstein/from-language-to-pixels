"The capital letter R has a distinct shape that is characterized by a diagonal line and a curved element. The diagonal line starts at the upper left corner and slants downwards towards the right, forming an angle of approximately 45 degrees. It is longer than the curved element. The curved element begins at the bottom of the diagonal line and curves outward to the right, before circling back around and ending at the bottom of the diagonal line. It resembles a backward 'C' shape. The curved element is positioned on the right side of the diagonal line, aligned with its bottom end. The spatial relationship between the diagonal line and the curved element creates a clear and recognizable shape."
