"The capital letter R has a distinctive shape that combines both straight and curved lines. It begins with a vertical line on the left side that extends downwards. About halfway down, the vertical line curves to the right, forming a rounded shape. This curve continues to the right and then curves back to the left, creating the top arch of the letter. The arch is symmetrical and smoothly transitions into a straight line that slopes downwards towards the right, ending at the baseline. The bottom part of the R is formed by a short horizontal line that connects to the rightmost point of the vertical line, creating a small tail. The proportions of the vertical line to the arch to the tail are balanced, with the arch being slightly longer than the tail. Overall, the R has a strong and distinct shape, with the vertical line and curved arch defining its unique appearance."
