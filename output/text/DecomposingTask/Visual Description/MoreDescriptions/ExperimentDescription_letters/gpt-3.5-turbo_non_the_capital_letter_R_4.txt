"""The capital letter R has a distinctive shape that combines both straight lines and curves. It can be thought of as a combination of a vertical line and an inverted 'C' shape. The vertical line stands upright on the left-hand side, extending downward and slightly curving to the right at the bottom. The curved element begins at the top of the vertical line, curving outward and upward in a smooth arc, before looping back inward to connect with the vertical line near its midpoint. The bottom portion of the vertical line continues downward, parallel to the curved element, creating a straight alignment between the two. The overall shape of the capital letter R can be described as a vertical line with a loop or arc attached near its top."""
