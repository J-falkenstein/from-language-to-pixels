The capital letter R has a distinct shape that consists of a diagonal line slanting from the top left to the bottom right. The line starts at the top left corner and extends downwards at an angle. Towards the bottom, the line curves sharply to the right, forming a rounded semicircle shape. The curve then continues upwards, mirroring the initial diagonal line but in a shorter length. The top right part of the R is straight and parallel to the initial diagonal line, connecting back to the starting point. The overall shape of the R can be likened to a right-leaning slope with a rounded bump at the bottom.
