"""The capital letter R is formed by a vertical straight line on the left side, starting from the top and extending downwards. At the top right of this line, there is a diagonal line that slants towards the right at a slight angle, starting from the top and extending downwards. About two-thirds of the way down this diagonal line, there is a small horizontal line that extends towards the left, connecting to the vertical line. This horizontal line is positioned slightly below the midpoint of the vertical line. The diagonal line and the horizontal line together form the lowercase letter "c". The bottom part of the vertical line curves outwards towards the right, creating a distinctive hook-like shape. This hook begins just below the horizontal line and extends slightly to the right, ending in a slight curve."""
