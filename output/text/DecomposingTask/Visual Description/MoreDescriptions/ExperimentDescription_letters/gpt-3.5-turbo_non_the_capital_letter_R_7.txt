"""The capital letter R has three main elements. The first element is a straight vertical line that starts at the top and extends downwards, stopping a little over halfway. The second element is a diagonal line that starts at the top and slants downwards and to the right, intersecting the first vertical line at a point slightly below its midpoint. The diagonal line is shorter than the vertical line, creating an angled gap between them. The third element is a curved line that starts at the bottom of the diagonal line on the right side and curves inward, forming a semi-circle shape. This curved line connects back to the vertical line at a point just below the point where the diagonal line intersects the vertical line. The overall shape of the letter R is angular and slightly asymmetrical, with the diagonal and curved lines creating a distinctive and recognizable form."""
