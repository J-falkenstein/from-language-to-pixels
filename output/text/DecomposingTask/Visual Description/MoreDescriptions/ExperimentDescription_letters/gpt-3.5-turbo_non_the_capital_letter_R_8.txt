"The capital letter R is composed of three distinct elements. It starts with a vertical line on the left side, aligned with a slight slant towards the right. This line is relatively straight and extends downward. At the bottom, it curves to the right in a semi-circle shape, forming the base of the letter. From the right end of the curved base, a diagonal line extends upwards and to the right, creating the right leg of the letter. This diagonal line is curved inwards slightly before ending in a small horizontal bar that is perpendicular to the vertical line. The proportions of the vertical line, curved base, and diagonal line are balanced, with the diagonal line being slightly shorter than the vertical line and curved base. The overall shape of the letter R is angular and distinct, with clear alignments and spatial relationships between the different elements."
