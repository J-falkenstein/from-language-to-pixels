"The capital letter R has a distinctive shape that includes both straight lines and curved elements. It is composed of a vertical straight line on the left side that starts at the top, slightly curves outwards to the right, and then curves back inwards towards the bottom. This curved element connects to a diagonal line that slants from the bottom left towards the top right. The diagonal line intersects with the vertical line at a point slightly above the halfway mark. At the end of the diagonal line, there is a small perpendicular line that extends horizontally to the right, creating a distinctive tail. The right side of the letter R remains open, without any additional lines or curves."
