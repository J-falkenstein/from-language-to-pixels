"""The capital letter S is a smooth, flowing shape that resembles a curvaceous snake or a winding river. It starts at the top left, curving gently to the right and then downwards in a graceful arc. Near the bottom, it smoothly changes direction, curving gently to the left and then upwards in a symmetrical arc towards the top right. The two arcs are aligned vertically, creating a balanced and harmonious shape. The top curve is slightly smaller and more compact than the bottom curve, with a gradual curve that transitions smoothly into the larger lower curve. Overall, the letter S has a fluid and organic quality, with no sharp angles or corners."""
