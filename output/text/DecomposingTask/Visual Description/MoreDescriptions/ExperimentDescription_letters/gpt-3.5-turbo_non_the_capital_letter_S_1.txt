"""The capital letter S has a sinuous and curvaceous shape, resembling a wavy line. It starts at the top left with a slight curve downwards to the right, then swoops downwards in a deep curve to the left, and finally curves upwards to the right again, forming a symmetrical shape. The top curve is larger and more pronounced than the bottom curve. The overall shape of the letter S is smooth and flowing, with no sharp angles or straight lines."""
