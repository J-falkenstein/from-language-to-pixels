"The capital letter S has a smooth, flowing shape that resembles a curved wave or snake. It starts with a slight curve to the left at the top, then flows smoothly to the right, forming a larger curve. As it reaches the bottom, the curve gradually decreases in size, creating a smaller curve to the left. Overall, the letter S has a graceful and elegant appearance, with no sharp angles or straight lines. Its proportions are such that the curves are evenly balanced and visually pleasing. The top and bottom curves are aligned horizontally, while the left and right edges maintain a vertical alignment."
