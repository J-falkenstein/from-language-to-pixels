"""The capital letter S is a curvaceous, flowing shape that resembles a wavy line. It starts with a downward curve on the left side, then forms a gentle upward curve towards the right. At the top, it smoothly transitions into a graceful downward curve that eventually loops back up and to the left in a smaller, tighter curve. The bottom of the letter is open, creating an empty space within the shape. Overall, the letter S has a dynamic and fluid appearance."""
