"The capital letter S is a curvaceous and flowing shape that resembles a wave or a snake. It begins with a gentle curve at the top left, curving downwards to the right. It then forms a more pronounced curve, bending upwards and to the left before cascading down and tapering off to the right. The overall shape resembles a reverse 'C' with an extra curve in the middle. The curves flow smoothly from one to the other, creating a sense of fluidity and elegance."
