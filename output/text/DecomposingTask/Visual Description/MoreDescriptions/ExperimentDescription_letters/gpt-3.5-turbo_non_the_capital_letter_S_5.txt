"""The capital letter S is characterized by a smooth, flowing curve that resembles a winding path. It starts at the top left corner and gradually curves downwards and to the right, forming the top part of the letter. The curve then transitions into a sharper angle, curving back in the opposite direction to create the bottom part of the letter. This second curve is shorter and more abrupt than the initial one. The top and bottom curves of the letter S are parallel to each other, creating a symmetrical shape. The overall shape of the letter is reminiscent of a long, stretched-out "S" or a snake-like form."""
