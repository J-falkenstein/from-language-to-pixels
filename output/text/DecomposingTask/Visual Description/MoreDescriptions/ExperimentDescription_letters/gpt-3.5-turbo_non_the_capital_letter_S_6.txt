"""The capital letter S is a curvilinear shape that resembles a wave. It starts with a vertical line curving slightly to the right at the top. This curve then transitions smoothly into a large curving line that moves downward and to the left, creating a deep "S" shape. The bottom of the "S" curves outward and upward to the right, forming a smaller loop. The letter S is symmetrical and follows a flowing, organic trajectory. The top and bottom curves align horizontally, while the overall shape is taller than it is wide."""
