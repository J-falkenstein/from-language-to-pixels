"The capital letter S has a distinctive winding shape that resembles a curled snake or a wavy river. It begins with a vertical line on the left side that curves to the right, forming the top half of the letter. It then smoothly curves downwards, creating a loop-like shape at the bottom. The curve then flows back up, mirroring the initial curve, and ends with a short horizontal line pointing to the right. The top and bottom curves are symmetrical and smooth, creating an elegant and flowing visual. The letter S appears to be in a vertical alignment, with its curves flowing in a clockwise direction."
