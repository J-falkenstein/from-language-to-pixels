"The capital letter S is characterized by two distinctive curves. It begins with a smooth, rounded curve that starts from the top left, arching gently downwards and to the right. This curve gradually transitions into a sharp, downward-pointing hook that loops and extends back up towards the left. The top section of the S is larger and more rounded, while the bottom section is smaller and has a sharper angle. The S is symmetrical, with the top and bottom curves aligning vertically. The overall shape of the S resembles a sinuous, flowing line that gracefully twists and turns."
