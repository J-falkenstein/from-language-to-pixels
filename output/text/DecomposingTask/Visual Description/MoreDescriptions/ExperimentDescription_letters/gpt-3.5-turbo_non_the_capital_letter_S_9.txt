"""The capital letter S is a curvaceous form that resembles two symmetrical waves, each with a single loop. Starting from the top left, a smooth curve flows downwards to the right, creating a loop that is wider and taller towards the bottom. The curve then seamlessly transitions into a second loop, mirroring the first but smaller in size. This second loop curves upwards to the left, reconnecting with the initial curve slightly above its starting point. The overall shape of the letter S is flowing and visually appealing, with the loops positioned one above the other and aligned in a gentle, graceful manner."""
