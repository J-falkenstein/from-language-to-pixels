"""The capital letter T is composed of two perpendicular lines. The vertical line extends from the top to the bottom of the canvas, creating a straight and upright orientation. The horizontal line intersects the vertical line in the middle, extending equally to the left and right. Both lines are of equal length and thickness, forming a symmetrical and balanced shape. The horizontal line is positioned slightly higher than the center of the vertical line."""
