The capital letter T is composed of two distinct elements. It consists of a vertical line in the middle that reaches from the top to the bottom of the canvas. This line is straight and aligned vertically. At the top of the vertical line, there is a horizontal line that protrudes slightly to the right and is centered with respect to the vertical line. The horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line, and it is completely perpendicular to it. The intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines forms a right angle, thus creating the shape of the capital letter T.
