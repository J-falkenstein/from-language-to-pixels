"The capital letter T is made up of two perpendicular lines. The vertical line is longer and extends from the top to the bottom of the space. It is completely straight and aligned centrally within the space. The horizontal line, which is shorter, intersects the vertical line at its midpoint. It is also completely straight and aligned horizontally within the space. The top end of the horizontal line touches the vertical line and they form a right angle at their intersection."
