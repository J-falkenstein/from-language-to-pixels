"""The capital letter T is comprised of a vertical line and a horizontal line intersecting it. The vertical line is longer and extends from the top to the bottom of the letter, creating a straight and upright appearance. The horizontal line is shorter and positioned in the middle of the vertical line, extending to both the left and right sides. The horizontal line is perpendicular to the vertical line, creating a right angle where they meet in the center of the letter."""
