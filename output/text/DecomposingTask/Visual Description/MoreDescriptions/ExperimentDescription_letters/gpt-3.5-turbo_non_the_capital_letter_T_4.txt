"""The capital letter T is comprised of two distinct elements: a long vertical line and a shorter horizontal line intersecting it at the center. The vertical line is straight and aligned in a vertical orientation from top to bottom, while the horizontal line is perpendicular to the vertical line and positioned centrally, crossing it at a right angle. The horizontal line extends equally in both directions from the vertical line, forming a symmetrical 'T' shape."""
