"The capital letter T is composed of two straight lines intersecting each other. The vertical line runs from the top to the bottom, dividing the letter into two equal parts. The horizontal line is shorter and located near the top of the vertical line. It stretches from the left side to the right side, perpendicular to the vertical line. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, and they intersect at a right angle, forming the shape of a cross. The vertical line is perfectly aligned with the center of the horizontal line."
