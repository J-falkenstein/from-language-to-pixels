"""The capital letter T is composed of two perpendicular lines that intersect at a central point. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, extending both above and below the point of intersection. The horizontal line is evenly aligned with the top of the vertical line, creating a clear and distinct cross shape. The proportions of the lines are such that the vertical line is significantly longer than the horizontal line, extending beyond its ends."""
