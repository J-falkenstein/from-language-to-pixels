"""The capital letter T is formed by one long vertical line intersecting one shorter horizontal line. The vertical line extends from the top to the bottom, while the horizontal line is positioned in the middle, connecting to the vertical line at a right angle. The horizontal line is slightly shorter than the vertical line, creating an elongated proportion. The two lines are aligned vertically and horizontally, with the horizontal line centered on the vertical line. The spatial relationship between the lines creates the distinct shape of the letter T."""
