"The capital letter U is a symmetrical, rounded shape that resembles the bottom half of an oval. It starts with a curved line on the left side, which gradually arches upwards, creating a smooth, rounded top. The top curve then gently slopes downward, connecting with a curved line on the right side. The bottom line is parallel to the top curve, creating a balanced and even shape. The overall form of the letter U is open and inviting, with a sense of stability and symmetry."
