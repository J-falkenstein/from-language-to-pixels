"""The capital letter U is a rounded letter that resembles a semicircle that has been rotated 180 degrees. It consists of a curved line that starts at the upper left side, curves downward to the right, and then curves back up to the upper right side. The top of the U is wider and more rounded than the bottom, creating a visually balanced shape. The interior of the U is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the letter. The U is aligned in a straight vertical orientation."""
