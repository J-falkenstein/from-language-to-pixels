The capital letter U is a symmetrical shape that resembles the outline of a cup or a horseshoe. It consists of a long, curved line that starts at the top left and curves downwards and to the right. The curve is perfectly smooth and forms a shape similar to half of an oval. This curved line gradually transitions into a straight, horizontal line at the bottom, connecting the two ends of the curve. The straight line is parallel to the ground and creates a flat base for the shape. The proportions of the U are such that the vertical height of the curve is usually slightly greater than the width of the shape. The curve and the straight line are seamlessly aligned and form a continuous, flowing shape without any breaks or sharp angles.
