"The capital letter U is a symmetrical shape that resembles an open container or a curved bowl. Its fundamental shape is that of a horizontal line at the top, which then curves downwards and outwards to form two vertical lines that are parallel to each other. The bottom ends of the vertical lines are connected by a curved line, creating a rounded and open bottom portion. The overall shape is similar to a horseshoe or the opening of a cup. The horizontal line at the top is longer than the vertical lines, and the distance between the vertical lines is consistent throughout. The curved line at the bottom is smooth and flows seamlessly into the vertical lines. The letter U is balanced and vertically aligned, with the top and bottom elements connecting seamlessly to create a cohesive shape."
