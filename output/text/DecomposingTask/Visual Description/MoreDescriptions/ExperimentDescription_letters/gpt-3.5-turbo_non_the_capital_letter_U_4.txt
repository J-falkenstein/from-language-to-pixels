"""The capital letter U is formed by a curved line that starts at the top left, curves gently to the right, and then descends diagonally towards the bottom right. The line is smooth and symmetrical, resembling the opening of a cup or a horseshoe shape. Both ends of the line are aligned horizontally, creating a balanced and even appearance. The curve of the line is consistent throughout, without any abrupt changes. The U is open and empty in the center, with no interior design or filling."""
