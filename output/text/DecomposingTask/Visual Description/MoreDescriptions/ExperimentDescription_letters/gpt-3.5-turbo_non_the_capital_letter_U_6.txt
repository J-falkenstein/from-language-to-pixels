"""The capital letter U is a symmetrical shape that resembles a curved line that is open at the bottom. It starts with a straight vertical line that curves outward to the right and then curves back inward to the left, forming a rounded bottom. The top of the U is a gentle curve that is parallel to the bottom portion, creating a mirror image. The proportions of the vertical line and the curvature of the U are equal, resulting in a balanced and cohesive shape."""
