"""The capital letter U is formed by two curved lines that meet at the bottom to create a symmetrical shape. The top part of the U is wider and curves gently downwards on both sides, forming the sides of the U. The bottom part of the U consists of a shorter, more pronounced curve that connects the two sides at the bottom. The curvature of the lines is smooth and continuous, creating a rounded appearance. The two sides of the U are parallel and equidistant, maintaining the same width throughout. The height of the U is slightly taller than its width, giving it a vertically elongated shape. The space within the U is open and empty, with no additional elements or lines inside."""
