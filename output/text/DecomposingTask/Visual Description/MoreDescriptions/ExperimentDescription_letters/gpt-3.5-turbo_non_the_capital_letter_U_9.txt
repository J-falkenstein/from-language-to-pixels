"""The capital letter U is a symmetrical shape that resembles two curved lines connected at the bottom. The top of the U starts with a straight horizontal line that extends to the left and right. From the ends of this line, two smooth, curved lines swoop downward and inward, almost resembling the shape of a shallow bowl. These curved lines meet at the bottom in a rounded point, creating a smooth and continuous shape. The proportions of the U are such that the width of the horizontal line is generally equal to the height of the curved lines. The overall orientation is vertical, with the U standing upright on its base."""
