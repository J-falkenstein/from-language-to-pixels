"""The capital letter V is a sharp, angular shape with two diagonal lines that meet at a point. The bottom of the V is wider and forms a straight, horizontal line. From this line, two diagonal lines extend upward and outward, converging at the top to create a pointed apex. The V is symmetrical, with the diagonal lines mirroring each other in length and angle. The angle of the lines is typically around 45 degrees, creating a sharp, pointed shape. The V stands upright, with the diagonal lines forming a vertical alignment."""
