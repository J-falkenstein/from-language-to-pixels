"""The capital letter V is a simple but distinctive shape. It consists of two straight lines that come together at a point, forming an angle. The lines are of equal length and are aligned vertically. The line on the left starts at the top and slopes diagonally downwards towards the right, while the line on the right starts at the top and slopes diagonally downwards towards the left. The point where the two lines meet is in the center of the letter. The angles formed by the lines are sharp and acute, creating a pointed appearance."""
