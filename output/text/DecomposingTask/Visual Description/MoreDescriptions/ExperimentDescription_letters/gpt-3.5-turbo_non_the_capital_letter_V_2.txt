"""The capital letter V is formed by two diagonal lines that meet at a point. The lines start at the bottom, slanting outward and upward to create a wide V shape. They are equal in length and angle, giving the letter a symmetrical appearance. The two lines are aligned vertically, with the point of intersection forming the center of the letter. The V is open, with the space between the lines forming a clear, open shape."""
