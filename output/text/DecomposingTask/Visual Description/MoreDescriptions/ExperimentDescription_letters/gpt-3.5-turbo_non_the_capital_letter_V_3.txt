"The capital letter V is formed by two diagonal lines that meet at a single point. The lines are of equal length and slope downward and outward from the point of intersection. The left line starts at the top left corner, slanting towards the right and ending at the bottom center. The right line starts at the top right corner, slanting towards the left and also ending at the bottom center. The point of intersection is positioned in the middle of the vertical axis, creating symmetry between the two diagonal lines."
