"""The capital letter V is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a point. The lines are equal in length and are slanted outward from the center, forming an acute angle. The top line starts at the left, slopes downward to the right, and intersects with the bottom line at its midpoint. The bottom line starts at the right, slopes upward to the left, and intersects with the top line at its midpoint. The point where the lines intersect is at the center of the letter, creating a symmetrical appearance. Both lines are straight and have a consistent thickness throughout. The overall shape of the V is open and angular, resembling an arrow pointing upward."""
