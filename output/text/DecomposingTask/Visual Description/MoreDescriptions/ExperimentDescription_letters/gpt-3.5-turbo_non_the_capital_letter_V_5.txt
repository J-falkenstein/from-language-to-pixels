"The capital letter V is a straight vertical line that starts at the bottom and extends upwards. At the top, the line splits into two diagonal lines that form a wide angle. The two diagonal lines are equal in length and slope inward towards each other. The bottom of the V is wider than the top, creating a triangular shape. The V is symmetrical, with the two diagonal lines appearing parallel to each other."
