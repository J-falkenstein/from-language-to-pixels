"""The capital letter V resembles two straight lines that intersect at a point, forming a sharp angle. The vertical line is longer and extends downward from the point of intersection, while the diagonal line is shorter and slants to the right. The top of the diagonal line aligns with the top of the vertical line, creating a distinctive triangular shape."""
