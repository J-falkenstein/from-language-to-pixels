The capital letter V is composed of two straight lines that intersect at a specific point. The lines are of equal length and are aligned diagonally in an upward direction, forming a sharp angle at their intersection. The line on the left starts at the bottom left corner and slants upwards towards the right, while the line on the right starts at the bottom right corner and slants upwards towards the left. The angles of both lines are equal, creating a symmetrical appearance. The space enclosed within the V shape is open and empty.
