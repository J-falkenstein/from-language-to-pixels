"""The capital letter V has a sharp, angular shape with two distinct diagonal lines that meet at a point. The line on the left starts at the top-left corner and slopes downward to the right, while the line on the right starts at the top-right corner and slopes downward to the left. The lines are symmetrical and equidistant from each other, forming a V shape. The bottom point where the lines meet is centered between the two diagonals, creating a balanced and centered appearance."""
