"The capital letter W is made up of three diagonal lines that intersect at points, forming a series of peaks and valleys. The center peak is the highest, while the two outer peaks are slightly shorter. The lines start at the bottom left and right corners and slope upwards towards the center. The uppermost point of the center peak aligns with the bottom points of the outer peaks, creating a symmetrical appearance. The overall shape of the W resembles a series of connected 'V' shapes, with the top points forming a subtle arch."
