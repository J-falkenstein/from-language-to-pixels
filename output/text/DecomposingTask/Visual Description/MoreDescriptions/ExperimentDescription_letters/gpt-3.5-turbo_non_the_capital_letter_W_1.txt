"The capital letter W is formed by three diagonal lines connected at their endpoints. The middle line is the longest and starts at the top left, slanting downwards towards the right, then curves back up and to the left at a sharp angle. The two outer lines, one on each side, start at the top and slant downwards towards the center, intersecting with the middle line at the same point. The overall shape of the letter W resembles an inverted 'V' with an extra diagonal line in the middle."
