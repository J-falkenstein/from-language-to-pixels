"The capital letter W is formed by three diagonal lines that intersect at two points. The lines are slanted towards the right and are symmetrical in shape. Starting from the top, the first diagonal line slants downwards and to the right, then abruptly changes direction and slopes upwards and to the right. The second diagonal line starts from the top-left and slants downwards and to the right, intersecting with the first line. It then curves and forms a loop, before sloping upwards and to the right. The third diagonal line starts from the top-right and slants downwards and to the right, intersecting with the first line at the bottom point. It then curves and forms a loop similar to the second line, before sloping upwards and to the right. The three diagonal lines are evenly spaced and create three distinct peaks and valleys within the letter W."
