"The capital letter W is composed of three diagonal lines. The middle line is the longest and slightly slanted to the right. On each side of the middle line, there are two shorter diagonal lines that are slanted in the opposite direction, forming a symmetrical shape. The top ends of the diagonal lines meet at a single point, creating a pointed apex. The bottom ends of the diagonal lines extend downwards and are parallel to each other, creating a flat base. The spatial relationship between the lines is such that they form a series of alternating peaks and valleys, giving the letter a distinct mountain-like appearance."
