"""The capital letter W is made up of three diagonal lines. It resembles two 'V' shapes that are connected at their bottom points. The middle line is longer than the two outer lines, and they are all aligned in a straight vertical orientation. The bottom points of the two outer lines touch the baseline, while the middle line extends slightly below it. The two outer lines are symmetrical, angling outward from the center, and then angling inward to meet the middle line, forming a recognizable 'W' shape."""
