"The capital letter W is formed by three diagonal lines. The center line is the longest and starts near the bottom left corner, slanting upwards towards the right at a steep angle. It then curves smoothly back to the left, forming a gentle arch before slanting downwards towards the right again to meet the baseline. The two outer lines are shorter and mirror each other, starting at the baseline and slanting sharply upwards towards the left, then curving smoothly back towards the right before meeting the center line at the peak of the arch. The resulting shape resembles two upside-down 'V' shapes joined together at the center."
