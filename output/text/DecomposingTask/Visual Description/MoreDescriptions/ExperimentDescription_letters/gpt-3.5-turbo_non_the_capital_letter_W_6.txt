"""The capital letter W consists of three diagonal lines that intersect at a central point. The first diagonal line starts at the top left and slants downward towards the right, then curves upwards towards the right, forming a soft peak. The second diagonal line starts at the top right and slants downward towards the left, then curves upwards towards the left, forming a similar soft peak. The third diagonal line starts at the bottom left and slants upward towards the right, intersecting the other two lines at the central point. The overall shape of the W resembles a series of sharp mountain peaks, with two shorter peaks on the sides and a taller peak in the middle. The lines are evenly spaced and aligned, creating equal angles between them."""
