"The capital letter W is composed of three diagonal lines. The top and bottom lines slant from the left to the right, while the middle line slants from the right to the left. All three lines intersect at three points, creating a series of triangular shapes. The top and bottom lines are longer than the middle line, and the distance between each line gradually decreases towards the center. The overall shape resembles an upside-down 'M' with a central point where the lines meet."
