The capital letter W is made up of three diagonal lines. The first line starts at the top left and slopes downwards towards the right, then curves back up and to the left. The second line starts at the top right and slopes downwards towards the left, then curves back up and to the right. The third line connects the two diagonal lines in the middle, running horizontally. The three lines are symmetrical and spaced evenly apart, creating a "V" shape at the top and bottom of the letter. The proportion between the diagonal lines and the horizontal line is approximately equal.
