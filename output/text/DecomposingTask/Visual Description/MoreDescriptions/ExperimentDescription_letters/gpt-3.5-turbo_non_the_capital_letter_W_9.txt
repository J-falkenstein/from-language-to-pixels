"""The capital letter W is made up of three diagonal, slanted lines. The first line starts at the top left corner and slants downward to the right at a slight angle. It is then followed by a second line that begins at the top right corner and slants downward to the left at a steeper angle. Finally, the third line connects the bottom ends of the first two lines and slants downward to the right again, creating a zigzag pattern. The three lines are of equal length and are evenly spaced apart, forming a symmetrical shape. The overall shape of the W resembles a series of connected, inverted V shapes."""
