"""The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines crossing each other at a central point. The lines are of equal length and thickness, creating a symmetrical appearance. The bottom left to top right line slopes upward from left to right, while the bottom right to top left line slopes upward from right to left. The lines intersect at a perpendicular angle in the center, with the point of intersection forming the central point of the X. The space between the lines is typically empty, creating four distinct triangular spaces at each of the four corners of the X."""
