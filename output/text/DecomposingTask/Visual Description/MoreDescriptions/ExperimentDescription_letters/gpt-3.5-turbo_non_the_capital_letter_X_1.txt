The capital letter X is composed of two diagonal lines intersecting each other in the center. The lines are of equal length and thickness. One line starts from the top left corner and extends to the bottom right corner, while the other line starts from the top right corner and extends to the bottom left corner. The lines meet at a point in the middle, creating a perpendicular intersection. The angles formed by the lines are symmetrical, with each diagonal line sloping in opposite directions. The X shape is aligned vertically and horizontally, with the diagonals perfectly crossing each other at the center.
