"""The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect each other in the center. The lines are straight and are aligned in an "X" shape, with one line slanting from the top left to the bottom right, and the other slanting from the top right to the bottom left. The lines are of equal length and meet at a 90-degree angle in the middle. The intersecting point is at the center of the letter, creating four triangular spaces around it."""
