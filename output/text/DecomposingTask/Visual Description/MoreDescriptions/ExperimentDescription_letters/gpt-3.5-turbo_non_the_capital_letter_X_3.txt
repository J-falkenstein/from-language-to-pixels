"The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at the center. The lines are of equal length and width, creating a symmetrical shape. The top diagonal line moves from the left upper corner to the right lower corner, while the bottom diagonal line moves from the left lower corner to the right upper corner. The intersection point is in the center of the X, creating a balanced and centered composition. The lines are straight and have no curves or angles. They do not touch or overlap beyond the intersection point."
