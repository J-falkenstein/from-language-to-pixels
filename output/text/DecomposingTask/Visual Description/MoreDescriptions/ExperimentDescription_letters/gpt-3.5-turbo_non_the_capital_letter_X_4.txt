"The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect in the center and create an 'X' shape. The lines are of equal length and thickness. The diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right slopes downward from left to right, while the diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left slopes downward from right to left. The intersection point is in the center of the 'X'. The lines are aligned vertically and horizontally."
