"""The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect each other in the center. The lines are of equal length and are oriented at a 45-degree angle. The first line starts from the top-left corner, slanting downwards to the bottom-right corner, while the second line starts from the top-right corner, slanting downwards to the bottom-left corner. The intersection point occurs exactly in the middle, creating four equal triangular regions around it. The lines are straight and extend from edge to edge of the space they're contained in, with no curves or bends."""
