"""The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines intersecting each other in the middle. The lines are of equal length and angle, creating four equal triangular sections. The top left to bottom right diagonal line slants from left to right, while the top right to bottom left diagonal line slants from right to left. The lines intersect at a central point in the middle, forming a perfect 'X' shape. Each diagonal line extends slightly beyond the point of intersection, creating a clear and defined intersection. The overall shape of the letter X is symmetrical and balanced."""
