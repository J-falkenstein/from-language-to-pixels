"The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect each other at a central point. Each line starts at opposite corners and extends diagonally towards the center. The lines are of equal length and meet at a 90-degree angle, creating four equal triangular sections. The top-left to bottom-right line slants from left to right, while the top-right to bottom-left line slants from right to left. The diagonal lines are parallel to each other and intersect at the center of the X, creating an 'X' shape."
