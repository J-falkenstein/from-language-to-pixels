"""The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at the center. Each line starts from opposite corners and extends outward, crossing over each other in the middle. The lines are of equal length and thickness, creating a symmetrical X shape. The angle at which the lines intersect is approximately 45 degrees. The two lines are parallel to the edges of the paper, and the X is positioned horizontally and vertically centered on the page."""
