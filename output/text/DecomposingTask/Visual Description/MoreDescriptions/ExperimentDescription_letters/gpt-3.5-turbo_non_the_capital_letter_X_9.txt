"The capital letter X is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a center point. The lines are of equal length and are positioned at a 45-degree angle to each other. The top left to bottom right diagonal line slants downward from left to right, while the top right to bottom left diagonal line slants downward from right to left. The lines cross each other at the center point, creating four equal sections. The intersection is precisely aligned, forming a symmetrical X shape."
