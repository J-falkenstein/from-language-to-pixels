"The capital letter Y is formed by three main elements. At the top, there is a diagonal line that starts from the left and slants downward to the right. It is slightly longer than the two other lines. On the left side of the diagonal line, there is a short horizontal line that starts at the same height as the top of the diagonal line and extends to the left. On the right side of the diagonal line, there is another short horizontal line that starts at the same height as the top of the diagonal line and extends to the right. The two horizontal lines are aligned vertically with the bottom of the diagonal line. The diagonal line and the two horizontal lines create a distinctive 'Y' shape."
