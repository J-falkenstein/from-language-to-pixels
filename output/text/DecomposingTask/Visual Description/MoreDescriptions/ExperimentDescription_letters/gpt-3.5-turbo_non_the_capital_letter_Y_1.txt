"The capital letter Y is composed of three distinct elements. It has a vertical stem that starts at the bottom and extends upwards. At the top of the stem, it splits into two diagonal branches that slant downward and outward. The branches are symmetrical and form an acute angle with the stem. The left branch is slightly longer than the right branch, and they are aligned with each other and the vertical stem in a straight line. The bottom of the stem is thicker and gradually tapers as it extends upward. The diagonal branches also taper towards their tips. The overall shape of the letter Y can be described as resembling a fork or a tree with diverging branches."
