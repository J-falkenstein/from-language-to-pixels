"""The capital letter Y is formed by three distinct lines. The top line is perfectly horizontal and is shorter in length compared to the other two lines. It is positioned at the uppermost part of the Y. Starting from the center point of the top line, two diagonal lines extend downward and outward in a V-shape. The diagonal lines are symmetrical and slightly longer than the top horizontal line. The left diagonal line extends to the left side and is positioned slightly higher. The right diagonal line extends to the right side and is positioned slightly lower. The three lines intersect at a single point, forming the bottom part of the Y. The overall shape of the Y is lopsided and resembles an inverted tree branch."""
