"""The capital letter Y is composed of three distinct straight lines. The upper line is horizontal and placed at the top of the Y. It is slightly shorter than the two other lines. The two downward slopes begin at the endpoints of the upper line, angling diagonally downwards to the left and right. These slopes are of equal length and angle, creating a symmetrical V shape. The bottom endpoints of the slopes extend slightly beyond the horizontal line, forming two points in opposite directions, resembling the branches of a tree. The overall shape of the Y is an inverted V with a horizontal line intersecting at the center."""
