"The capital letter Y is comprised of three distinct elements. At the top, there is a diagonal line that starts at the left, slants downwards to the right, and ends in the middle. Below this diagonal line, there are two straight vertical lines that extend downwards. These lines are evenly spaced and aligned with each other, with the right line being shorter than the left line. The bottom ends of both vertical lines are connected by a horizontal line, forming a Y shape overall."
