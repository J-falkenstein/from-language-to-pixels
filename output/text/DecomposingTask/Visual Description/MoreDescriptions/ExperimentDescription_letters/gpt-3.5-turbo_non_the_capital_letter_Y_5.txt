"""The capital letter Y is composed of three distinct lines. At the top, there is a diagonal line that starts from the left and slants downwards to the right at a slight angle. Below this diagonal line, there are two vertical lines that are parallel to each other, aligned in a straight vertical orientation. The first vertical line starts from the bottom left, slightly slanting to the right, and ends at the midpoint of the diagonal line. The second vertical line starts from the bottom right and is aligned parallel to the first vertical line, ending at the same midpoint as the first. The diagonal line and the two vertical lines create a distinctive Y shape, with the diagonal line acting as the stem and the two vertical lines as the branches."""
