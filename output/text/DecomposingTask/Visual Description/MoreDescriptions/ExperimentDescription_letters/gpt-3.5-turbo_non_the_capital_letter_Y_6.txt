"The capital letter Y is composed of three distinct elements. It begins with a straight vertical line that starts from the bottom and extends upwards. At the top of this line, it branches out into two diagonal lines that slant inward towards each other. These diagonal lines are of equal length and form a V shape, with the bottom point of the V touching the top end of the vertical line. The diagonal lines are aligned in a symmetrical manner, creating a balanced and upright appearance."
