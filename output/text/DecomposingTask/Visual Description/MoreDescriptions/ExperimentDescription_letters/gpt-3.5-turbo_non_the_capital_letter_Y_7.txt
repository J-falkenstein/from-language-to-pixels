"""The capital letter Y is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a central point. The upper diagonal line starts at the top left corner and slopes downwards towards the right, curving slightly. The lower diagonal line starts at the bottom left corner and slopes upwards towards the right, mirroring the same curve as the upper diagonal line. The two diagonal lines meet at the central point, creating a sharp angle. The top diagonal line is longer than the bottom diagonal line, giving the letter a distinct asymmetrical appearance. The spacing between the two diagonal lines is equal, forming a narrow V-shape at the intersection point. Each diagonal line has a consistent thickness from start to end, creating a smooth and continuous visual flow."""
