"The capital letter Y is formed by three distinct straight lines. The vertical line is long and extends from the bottom to the top of the letter, slightly tilting to the right as it ascends. At the top of the vertical line, two diagonal lines diverge from the center, creating a V-shape. The diagonal lines are of equal length and slope downwards and outwards from the center. The left diagonal line angles towards the left, while the right diagonal line angles towards the right. The three lines intersect at a point near the middle of the vertical line, creating the characteristic forked shape of the letter Y."
