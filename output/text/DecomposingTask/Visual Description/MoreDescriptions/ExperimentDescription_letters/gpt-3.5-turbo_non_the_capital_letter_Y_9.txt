"The capital letter Y is composed of three distinct elements. It begins with a vertical line that descends from a point at the top. About two-thirds of the way down, the line splits into two diagonal lines, branching out in opposite directions. These diagonal lines are angled outward, forming a V shape. The top portion of the Y is longer than the two diagonal lines, creating an asymmetrical appearance. The vertical line aligns with the center of the V shape, while the diagonal lines continue downward to form the arms of the Y. The ends of the diagonal lines do not touch any other element, creating a clear space between them and the vertical line."
