The capital letter Z resembles two diagonal lines that intersect at a perpendicular angle. The top line starts at the top left corner and slants downward towards the right, ending at the bottom right corner. The bottom line starts at the bottom left corner and slants upward towards the right, intersecting the top line at a right angle. The top line is slightly longer than the bottom line. Both lines are straight and aligned in a diagonal orientation. The intersection point is in the middle of the letter, forming a sharp point. The entire letter is enclosed and does not have any open spaces or loops.
