"""The capital letter Z is composed of two diagonal lines that intersect at a right angle. The first line starts at the top left corner, slants downward and to the right, and ends at the bottom right corner. The second line starts at the top right corner, slants downward and to the left, and intersects the first line at its midpoint. The lines are of equal length and thickness, and there is no curvature in their shape. The angles formed by the lines are sharp and distinct."""
