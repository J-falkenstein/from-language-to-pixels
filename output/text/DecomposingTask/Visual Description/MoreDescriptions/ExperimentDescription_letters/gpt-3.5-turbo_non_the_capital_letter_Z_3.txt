The capital letter Z has a distinctive zigzag shape. It starts with a diagonal line that slants upwards from left to right, creating an angle of approximately 45 degrees. This line is shorter and thicker than the other diagonal line that follows. The second diagonal line starts at the endpoint of the first line and slants downwards from right to left, forming a symmetrical shape. The angle between the two lines mirrors the angle of the first line. The second line is longer and thinner than the first line. The two diagonal lines are connected by a short horizontal line at the bottom, which is aligned with the baseline of the letter. The letter Z is typically written in a straight vertical orientation, with the diagonal lines slanting at a consistent angle. The overall shape is sharp and angular, with clean, straight lines forming the zigzag pattern.
