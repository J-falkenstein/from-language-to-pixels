"""The capital letter Z has two diagonal lines that intersect to form a sharp angle. The top diagonal line starts at the upper left corner and slopes down to the right, slightly longer than the bottom diagonal line. The bottom diagonal line starts at the lower left corner and slopes up to the right. Both lines meet at a point near the middle of the letter, creating a distinctive zigzag shape. The overall structure of the letter Z is symmetrical, with the two diagonal lines parallel to each other and aligned in a diagonal orientation."""
