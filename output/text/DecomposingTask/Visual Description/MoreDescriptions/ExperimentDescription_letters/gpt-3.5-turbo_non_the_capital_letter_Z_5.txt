"The capital letter Z is a diagonal line that starts at the top left corner and slants downward to the bottom right corner. It is then followed by a diagonal line that starts at the bottom left corner and slants upward to meet the first line at a right angle. The two lines are of equal length and create a zigzag pattern resembling the letter Z."
