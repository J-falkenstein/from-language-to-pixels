"The capital letter Z is composed of two diagonal lines that intersect at a sharp angle. The top diagonal line starts at the left and slants downwards towards the right, stopping halfway down the height of the letter. The bottom diagonal line starts at the right and slants upwards towards the left, intersecting with the top line at the halfway point. The lines are of equal length and have a consistent width throughout. The letter Z stands upright and is aligned vertically."
