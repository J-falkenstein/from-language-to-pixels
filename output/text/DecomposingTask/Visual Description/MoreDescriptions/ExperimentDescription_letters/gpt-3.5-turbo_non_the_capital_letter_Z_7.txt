"""The capital letter Z is formed by two diagonal lines intersecting at a right angle. The first line starts at the top left corner and slopes downward to the bottom right corner. The second line starts at the top right corner, slopes downward, and crosses over the first line at a midpoint. The lines are of equal length, creating an isosceles triangle shape. The angles formed by the intersecting lines are sharp, creating distinct corners. The lines are parallel and aligned diagonally in a right-to-left direction."""
