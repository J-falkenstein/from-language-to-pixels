"The capital letter Z is comprised of two diagonal lines that intersect at a right angle. The first diagonal line starts at the top left corner and slopes downward and to the right at a 45-degree angle. The second diagonal line starts at the top right corner and slopes downward and to the left at the same 45-degree angle. The lines are of equal length and meet in the middle, creating a sharp point. The overall shape of the letter Z is reminiscent of a lightning bolt or a diagonal slash. The lines are straight and uninterrupted, with no curves or bends."
