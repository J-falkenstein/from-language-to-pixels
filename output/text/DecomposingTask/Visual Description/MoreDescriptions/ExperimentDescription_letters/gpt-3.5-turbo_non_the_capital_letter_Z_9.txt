"""The capital letter Z is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect at a right angle in the middle. The bottom line is longer and starts from the left side, slanting upwards and slightly to the right. The top line is shorter and starts from the right side, slanting downwards and slightly to the left. The intersection point of the two lines is in the center of the letter, creating a sharp corner. The lines are straight, without any curves or bends."""
