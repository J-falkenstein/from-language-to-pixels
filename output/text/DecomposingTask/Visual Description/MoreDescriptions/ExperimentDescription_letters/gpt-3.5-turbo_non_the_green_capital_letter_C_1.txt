"The green capital letter C has a curved shape that resembles a half-circle. The top of the C starts on the left side and curves upward, forming a smooth arc. It then descends in a gentle curve, ending on the right side. The C is oriented in a vertical position, with the curved portion facing towards the right. The interior of the C is typically empty, creating an open space within the curved shape. The color of the C is a vibrant green, giving it a visually distinct appearance."
