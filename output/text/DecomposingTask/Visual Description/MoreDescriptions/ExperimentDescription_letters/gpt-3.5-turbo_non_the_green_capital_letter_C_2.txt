"The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a partial circle. The curve of the letter starts at the bottom left and flows smoothly upwards, curving to the right and ending at the top right. The top portion of the curve is slightly elongated, making it taller than the bottom portion. The inner and outer edges of the curve are parallel, creating a uniform thickness throughout. The open space within the curve is empty, providing a clear contrast to the surrounding background. The color of the letter is a vibrant shade of green, giving it a visually striking appearance."
