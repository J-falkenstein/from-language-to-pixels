"The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a half-circle. It starts on the left side, curving upwards and then smoothly transitioning to a horizontal alignment before curving back down and ending on the right side. The top and bottom edges of the letter are parallel, creating a symmetrical shape. The color of the letter is a vibrant green, adding to its visual impact. The interior of the letter is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the curved shape."
