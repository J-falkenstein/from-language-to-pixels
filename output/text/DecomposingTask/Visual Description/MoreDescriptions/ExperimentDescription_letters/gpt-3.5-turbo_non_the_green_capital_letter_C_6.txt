"The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a half-circle. The bottom portion of the C is a smoothly curved line that starts on the left side, gradually curves upwards, and then gradually curves back to the right, forming the top portion of the C. The top and bottom portions of the C are connected at two endpoints, creating an open space within the curved shape. The C is aligned vertically in a straight orientation, with the bottom of the curve resting on an imaginary baseline. The interior of the C is filled with the color green, creating a solid, vibrant appearance."
