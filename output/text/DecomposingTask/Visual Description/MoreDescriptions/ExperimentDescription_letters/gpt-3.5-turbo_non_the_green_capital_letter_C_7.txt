"""The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a half circle. The curve starts at the top left corner and gradually slopes downward, creating a smooth arc. The curve ends at the bottom right corner, forming a closed shape. The top and bottom edges of the curve are aligned horizontally, creating a symmetrical appearance. The interior of the letter C is filled with solid green color, while the outer edges are defined by a thin, dark green outline. The overall proportion of the letter C is taller than it is wide, with the vertical height being greater than the horizontal width. The smooth curve and distinct shape of the letter C make it easily recognizable and distinguishable from other letters or objects."""
