"The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a backwards facing half-circle. Starting from the left side, the curved line smoothly arches upwards and then gently curves back towards the right, ending in the middle. The entire shape has a uniform thickness and the curvature is consistent throughout. The top portion of the C is open and airy, with no additional lines or markings within it. The bottom portion of the C is a closed loop, forming a complete shape. The color green adds vibrancy and richness to the letter, giving it a sense of energy and liveliness."
