"The green capital letter C is a curved shape that resembles a half-circle with an opening on the right side. The top of the curve starts on the left side, gradually curving upwards and then curling back towards the right side, forming a smooth arc. The bottom of the curve is connected to a straight vertical line that extends downwards from the right side of the curve. The vertical line is aligned with the right side of the curve, creating a continuous flow from the curve to the line. The overall shape of the letter C is symmetrical and well-defined, with a clear and distinct curve and line. The color of the letter is green, which fills the entire shape evenly and smoothly. The green color has a vibrant and lively appearance, creating a visually appealing contrast against a white background."
