The letter Ä is a capital letter with a distinctive shape. It consists of two main components: a horizontal line with two dots above it, and a vertical line crossing through the horizontal line slightly to the right.

The horizontal line is straight and positioned in the middle of the letter. Its length is slightly longer than the dots above it. The dots are positioned directly above the horizontal line, equidistant from each other and from the edges of the letter. The dots are small and are aligned vertically.

The vertical line starts at the top of the letter and extends down, crossing through the horizontal line at a slight angle to the right. It is shorter in length than the horizontal line but still extends beyond the top and bottom edges of the letter. The angle of the vertical line is noticeable but not too steep.

The proportions of the letter Ä are balanced, with the horizontal line and the dots taking up the majority of the width, and the vertical line adding height to the overall shape. The dots are aligned vertically with the center of the horizontal line, and the vertical line intersects the horizontal line slightly to the right of its center.

Overall, the letter Ä can be visualized as a horizontal line with two dots above it, and a vertical line crossing through the horizontal line at a slight angle to the right.
