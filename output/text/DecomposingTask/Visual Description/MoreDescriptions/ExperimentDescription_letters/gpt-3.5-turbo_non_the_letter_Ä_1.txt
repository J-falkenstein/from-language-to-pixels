"""The letter Ä is comprised of two distinct elements. It begins with a diagonal line that slopes upwards from left to right, starting at the bottom left corner and ending at the top right corner. This line is slightly longer than the diagonal line in the letter A. At the top right corner of the diagonal line, there is a horizontal line that connects to the top left corner, creating a cross-like shape. The horizontal line is shorter than the diagonal line, and it is positioned slightly lower. Within the cross-like shape, there is a centrally located vertical line that extends downwards from the intersection of the diagonal and horizontal lines, reaching just below the midpoint of the diagonal line. The vertical line is aligned with the diagonal line and is thinner in width. Overall, the letter Ä has a slanted and angular appearance, formed by the combination of these distinct elements."""
