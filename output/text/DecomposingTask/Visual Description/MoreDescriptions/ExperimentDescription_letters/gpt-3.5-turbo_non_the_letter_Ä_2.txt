The letter Ã„ is comprised of two distinct elements. It resembles two straight vertical lines that are parallel and evenly spaced apart. The lines are connected by a horizontal line at the top, forming a rectangular shape. Inside the rectangle, there is a smaller horizontal line in the center, dividing the shape into two equal parts. The bottom half of the rectangle is filled in and the top half is left empty, creating a clear contrast. The overall shape is symmetrical and the proportions of the lines and spaces are balanced.
