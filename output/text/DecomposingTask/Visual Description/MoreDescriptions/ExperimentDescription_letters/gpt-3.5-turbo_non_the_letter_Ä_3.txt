"The letter Ã„ is formed by two distinct elements. The first element is a diagonal line that slants from the top left corner to the bottom right corner at a steep angle. The line is slightly longer than the height of the letter. The second element is a horizontal line that intersects the diagonal line near its midpoint, extending to the right. The horizontal line is shorter in length compared to the diagonal line. The intersection between the two lines creates a sharp corner. The diagonal and horizontal lines are parallel to each other, forming a balanced and symmetrical appearance."
