"""The letter Ä is made up of two distinct elements. It features a horizontal line positioned in the middle, which is slightly longer than it is wide. Above this line, there are two diagonal lines that come together at a point above the horizontal line. The left diagonal line slants upwards and to the right, while the right diagonal line slants upwards and to the left. These diagonal lines are shorter than the horizontal line, and their top ends meet at a point slightly above the middle of the horizontal line. The overall shape of the letter Ä is somewhat rectangular, with the diagonal lines adding a unique and recognizable feature."""
