"""The letter Ä is composed of two distinct elements. The first element is a diagonal line that starts from the top left corner and slopes downward to the right at a slight angle. The length of this line is approximately half the height of the letter. The second element is a horizontal line that is positioned directly below the diagonal line. It runs parallel to the baseline and is slightly shorter in length compared to the diagonal line. The two lines intersect at the right end of the diagonal line, forming a sharp point. The diagonal line is thicker and more prominent than the horizontal line, creating a noticeable contrast between the two elements. The overall shape of the letter Ä is similar to a V with a horizontal line attached to the right end."""
