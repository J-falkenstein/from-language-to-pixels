"""The letter Ã„ is composed of two distinct elements. The upper element is a diagonal line that slants upwards from the bottom left to the top right. The lower element is a horizontal line that is positioned midway between the top and bottom of the letter and is parallel to the top of the letter. At the intersection of these two lines, there is a small horizontal line that connects them, creating a small gap in the middle. The diagonal line is longer than the horizontal line, and the gap is slightly wider than the width of the horizontal line."""
