The letter Ä is comprised of two distinct elements. It is formed by a horizontal line in the middle, with two vertical lines extending upwards from each end of the horizontal line. The horizontal line is the longest element and is positioned slightly above the midpoint of the two vertical lines. The vertical lines are relatively shorter and symmetrically aligned on both sides of the horizontal line. Each vertical line has a small hook or curl at the top, facing inward towards the center of the letter. These hooks give the letter Ä its distinctiveness. The overall shape of the letter is rectangular, with the horizontal line serving as the main structure and the vertical lines serving as supporting elements. The proportions of the letter are balanced, with the horizontal line being longer than the vertical lines, which are of equal length. The letter is aligned vertically, with the vertical lines extending straight upwards from the horizontal line. The spatial relationship between the elements is straightforward and easily distinguishable.
