The letter Ä is comprised of two distinct elements. It consists of a horizontal line at the top, slightly curving downward to the right. This line is relatively short in length. Below the horizontal line, there is a diagonal line that starts at the left side of the line and curves upwards and to the right. The diagonal line is longer than the horizontal line and forms a sharp angle at its intersection point with the horizontal line. The letter Ä is symmetrical, meaning that the diagonal line and the bottom part of the horizontal line mirror each other. The diagonal line is the longer of the two elements and gives the letter its distinctive shape.
