The letter Ä is an uppercase letter in the form of two distinct elements. The first element is a vertical line that starts from the baseline (the imaginary line where the letters sit) and extends upward, reaching the height of two-thirds of the total letter height. The line is straight and aligned vertically.

At the top of the vertical line, there is a horizontal line that extends to the right. This line is slightly shorter than the vertical line and is positioned at the same height. The horizontal line is aligned parallel to the baseline.

From the right end of the horizontal line, there is a diagonal line that starts at a 45-degree angle. This diagonal line is longer than both the vertical and horizontal lines and extends to the bottom right. It is positioned above the baseline and aligned with the imaginary diagonal line connecting the top right corner of the vertical line to the bottom left corner of the horizontal line.

The diagonal line intersects with the vertical line slightly below the top, creating a connection between the two elements. The intersection forms a right angle, with the diagonal line continuing below the vertical line in a straight downward direction.

Overall, the letter Ä has a distinct vertical line as its main element, topped with a shorter horizontal line, and connected to a longer diagonal line that extends to the bottom right. The letter is aligned with the baseline and follows a straightforward, angular design.
