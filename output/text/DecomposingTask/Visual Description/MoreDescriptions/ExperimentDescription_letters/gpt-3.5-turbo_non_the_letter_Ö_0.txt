"The letter Ã– is similar to two vertically aligned dots with a short, horizontal line on top. The dots are centered vertically and horizontally, one on top of the other, and slightly closer together than the width of the dots. The horizontal line sits directly above the dots, extending slightly to the left and right sides. It is shorter in length than the width of the dots and is centered horizontally between them."
