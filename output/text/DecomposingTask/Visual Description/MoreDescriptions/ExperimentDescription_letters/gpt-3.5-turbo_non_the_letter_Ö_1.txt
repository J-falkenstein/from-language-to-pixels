"""The letter Ö consists of two distinct elements. It starts with a horizontal line that is slightly longer than the width of the letter. On top of this horizontal line is a vertically elongated oval shape, with the top and bottom ends of the oval touching the horizontal line. The oval is centered vertically above the horizontal line, creating a symmetrical appearance. The oval is wider at the top and bottom, with the sides tapering inward towards the center. Inside the oval, there is an open space, creating a clear distinction between the oval and the horizontal line. Overall, the letter Ö has a compact and rounded appearance, with the oval shape dominating the visual composition."""
