"""The letter Ö is composed of two distinct elements. The first element is a horizontal line that is positioned slightly above the center of the letter. It extends across the entire width of the letter and serves as the base. The second element is two vertically aligned dots positioned directly above the horizontal line. These dots are smaller than the base and are aligned with the left and right edges of the letter. They are equidistant from the base, creating a symmetrical and balanced appearance. The dots are centered vertically within the letter, with equal spacing above and below them. Together, these elements create the distinctive and recognizable shape of the letter Ö."""
