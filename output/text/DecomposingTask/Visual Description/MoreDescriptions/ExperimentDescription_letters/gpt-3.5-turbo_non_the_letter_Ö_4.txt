"""The letter Ã– is comprised of two elements. On the top, there is a horizontal line that is slightly longer than the height of the two vertical lines below it. The vertical lines are evenly spaced on either side of the horizontal line, and they are symmetrical in length and alignment. Each vertical line starts at the bottom of the horizontal line and extends downward. They are parallel and equidistant from each other. The space between the vertical lines is empty, forming a clear, open space within the letter."""
