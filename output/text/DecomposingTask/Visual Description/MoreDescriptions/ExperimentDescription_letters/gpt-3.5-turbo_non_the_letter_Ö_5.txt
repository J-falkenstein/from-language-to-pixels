"The letter Ã– is composed of two distinct elements. It appears as if an upper-case letter 'O' is placed above an umlaut, or two dots. The 'O' is a perfect circle, with no noticeable irregularities or deformations. It is aligned directly above the umlaut, with the dots centered horizontally within the 'O'. The dots are small and round, positioned side by side, one slightly higher than the other, and both equidistant from the sides of the 'O'. The umlaut is vertically aligned with the 'O', and its height extends slightly above the top of the 'O'."
