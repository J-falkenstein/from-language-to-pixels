"""The letter Ö is composed of two elements: a vertical line with two small dots on top. The vertical line is slightly curved to the left at the top, then straightens out towards the bottom. The dots are positioned symmetrically above the line, equidistant from each other and from the top of the line. The dots are small and circular, sitting parallel to each other with a small gap in between. The entire letter Ö has a balanced and centered appearance, with the dots sitting directly above the middle of the vertical line."""
