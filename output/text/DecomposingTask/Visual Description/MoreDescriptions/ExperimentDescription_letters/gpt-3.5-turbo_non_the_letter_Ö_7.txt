"""The letter Ã– is comprised of two distinct elements. It consists of a horizontal line, slightly longer than the width of the letter, positioned in the middle. Above this line, there are two dots that are aligned vertically and centered horizontally. The dots are symmetrical and identical in size, with a slight spacing between them and the horizontal line. The dots are smaller than the width of the letter, but larger than a typical dot. The horizontal line and dots are aligned in a straight horizontal orientation, with the dots positioned directly above the middle of the line.""
