The letter Ö is comprised of two distinct elements. The top element is a horizontal line that is parallel to the baseline. Centered directly beneath this line is the second element, which resembles two vertically oriented dots that are aligned in the center. The dots are relatively small in size compared to the horizontal line, and their height extends just slightly above and below the midline of the letter. The dots are positioned symmetrically around the vertical axis of the letter, with equal spacing on either side of the centerline. The dots are aligned with the horizontal line, with the top of each dot touching the bottom of the line. The overall shape of the letter Ö can be described as two parallel horizontal lines with two vertically aligned dots centered beneath the top line.
