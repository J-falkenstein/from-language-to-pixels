"""The letter Ö is formed by two distinct elements. At the top, there are two dots, one above the other, aligned vertically. The dots are small and round, with the top dot slightly larger than the bottom dot. Beneath the dots, there is a horizontal line that connects them. The line is straight and extends across the width of the dots. The dots are centered above the line, with equal spacing on either side. The overall shape of the letter Ö is similar to a capital letter 'O' with two dots positioned above it."""
