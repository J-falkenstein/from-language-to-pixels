The letter Ãœ is formed by a straight, vertical line with two horizontal dots resting on top of it. The line is thicker and longer than the dots, creating a clear distinction between them. The line extends straight upward from a base, similar to a capital letter "I". The two dots, also known as umlauts, are perfectly aligned horizontally and centered above the line. They are smaller in size compared to the line, resembling two tiny, evenly-spaced circles sitting in a row on top of the line. The dots are placed symmetrically on either side of the line, with equal spacing from the line's edges. Together, the line and dots form the shape of a lowercase letter "u" with two dots sitting on top.
