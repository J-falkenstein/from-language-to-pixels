"The letter Ü is a combination of two distinct elements. It starts with a horizontal line that is slightly curved upwards in the middle, resembling a smile. Above this line, there is a pair of two dots, one on top of the other, positioned directly above the middle of the curved line. The dots are close together and aligned vertically. Together, the curved line and the dots create the letter Ü, forming a unique and recognizable shape."
