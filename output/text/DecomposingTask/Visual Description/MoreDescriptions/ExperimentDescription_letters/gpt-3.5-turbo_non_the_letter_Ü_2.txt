"The letter Ãœ is comprised of three distinct elements. It starts with a straight vertical line positioned slightly to the left. At the top of this line, there is a horizontal line that extends to the right. This horizontal line is shorter than the vertical line and is perfectly aligned with its top end. Finally, located above the right end of the horizontal line, there is a small, rounded element that resembles the dot on top of the letter 'i'. This rounded element is centered above the right end of the horizontal line."
