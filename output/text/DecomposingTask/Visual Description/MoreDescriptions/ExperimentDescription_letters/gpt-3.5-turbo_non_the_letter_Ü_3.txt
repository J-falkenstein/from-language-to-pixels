"""The letter Ãœ is composed of two distinct elements. It has a straight vertical line placed in the middle, which extends from the bottom to the top of the letter. At the top of this vertical line, there are two smaller horizontal lines, one on top of the other, forming a horizontal bar. The top horizontal line is longer and slightly curved, while the bottom one is shorter and straight. This horizontal bar is centered and aligned with the vertical line. The bottom part of the letter is open, creating a clear space underneath the vertical line."""
