"""The letter Ãœ is composed of two elements: a horizontal line and two vertical dots. The horizontal line is positioned at the top, spanning across the width of the character. The two vertical dots are located directly beneath the ends of the horizontal line, one dot on each side. The dots are aligned with the outer edges of the horizontal line and slightly higher than the midpoint. The dots are smaller in size compared to the horizontal line, and they are evenly spaced from each other."""
