"The letter Ü is formed by two distinct elements. It features a straight vertical line with a horizontal line on top. The horizontal line is slightly shorter than the vertical line and is positioned directly above it, creating a visually balanced appearance. At the top ends of the vertical line, there are two diagonal lines, one on each side, slanting inward towards the center. These diagonal lines connect to the horizontal line at the outer edges, forming two distinct curves that resemble the shape of a shallow bowl or a horseshoe. The overall shape of the letter Ü is symmetrical, with the curves mirroring each other on both sides of the vertical line."
