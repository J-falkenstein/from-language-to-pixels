"The letter Ü is a combination of two elements. At the bottom, there is a horizontal line that serves as the base. Above the base, there is a vertical line that starts on the left side and extends upward with a slight curve to the right. The top end of the vertical line is connected to two short and parallel horizontal lines that extend outward to the right, resembling two small arms extending from the main vertical line. These arms are aligned with the top end of the vertical line and have a slight upward tilt. The overall shape of the letter Ü is reminiscent of a person with outstretched arms."
