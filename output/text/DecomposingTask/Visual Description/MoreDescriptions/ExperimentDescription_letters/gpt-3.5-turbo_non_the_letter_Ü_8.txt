"The letter Ü is formed by two distinct elements. It starts with a straight vertical line that extends upward from a point slightly below the midpoint. This line is relatively short and thick, ending with a slight horizontal curve at the top. Above this line, there is a horizontal arc that is centered around the top point of the vertical line. The arc starts from the left side, moving downward and then curving back up to the right side, forming a shape similar to a wide 'U'. The bottom of the arc aligns with the top of the vertical line. Together, these two elements create the letter Ü, with the vertical line placed below and in the center of the arc."
