"""The letter Ü is composed of two distinct parts. The first part is a vertical line that stands straight and is fairly short in length. It starts at the bottom and extends upwards to approximately two-thirds of the total height of the letter. At the top end of this vertical line, there is a horizontal line that stretches out to the right. This horizontal line is longer than the vertical line and is positioned slightly above its midpoint. It creates a small, open space with the vertical line, forming a kind of "hat" shape. The horizontal line is parallel to the top of the letter and has a slight upward curve at the end, giving it a gently curved appearance. Together, the vertical line and the horizontal line form the letter Ü, with the horizontal line resting on top of the vertical line in a centered position."""
