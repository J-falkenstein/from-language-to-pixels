The letter ß is a unique character used in the German language. It consists of two distinct elements. The top element is a horizontal line, much like an elongated dash, that is positioned slightly below the midpoint of the character. The bottom element is a mirrored and elongated lower-case letter 's', which loops back and connects to the top element at the left side. The top element is slightly shorter than the bottom element, creating an angled connection between the two. The letter ß can be thought of as a combination of a horizontal line and a curved, mirrored 's' shape, with the 's' shape connecting to the horizontal line at an angle.
