"""The letter ÃŸ is a unique character in the German alphabet. It is composed of two distinct elements. The first element is a vertical line that is slightly tilted to the right. It starts at the top left and extends downwards, ending at the midpoint. The second element is a shape that resembles a lowercase 'b' or a rounded, elongated 's'. It is positioned to the right of the vertical line and shares its starting point. The curved portion of the shape starts at the top, curls inwards towards the right, then loops back around to the left, forming a closed circle-like shape. The bottom of the curved portion connects to the end of the vertical line, creating a smooth transition between the two elements."""
