"""The letter 'ÃŸ', also known as 'Eszett' or 'sharp s', is a lowercase letter unique to the German alphabet. It is composed of two distinct elements that are connected. The top element is similar to a lowercase 'B' or 'beta' character, with two vertical lines that are parallel to each other and slightly tilted to the right. The bottom element resembles a lowercase 's' or 'sigma' character, with a single curved line that starts at the top left of the vertical lines, curves to the right, and then curves back to the left, ending in a sharp, distinct point. The top and bottom elements are joined where the bottom curved line intersects the vertical lines, forming a connected and cohesive letter."""
