"The letter ß is a lowercase letter that is specific to the German language. It is a combination of the letters 'b' and 's' fused together. The shape of the letter resembles a stylized lowercase 'b' with a long vertical line extending from the top right corner of the letter. The bottom part of the letter curves inward towards the center, creating a loop-like shape. The vertical line is slightly angled and positioned closer to the right side of the letter. The ß has a distinct, curvaceous appearance, with the top of the letter being broader and rounder than the bottom."
