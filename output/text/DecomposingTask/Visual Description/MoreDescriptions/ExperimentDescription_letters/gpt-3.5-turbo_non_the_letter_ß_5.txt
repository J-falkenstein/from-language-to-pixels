"""The letter ÃŸ is a unique symbol in the German alphabet. It has two distinct elements, a vertical line and a curved shape. The vertical line is located on the left side of the symbol and extends from the top to the bottom. It is relatively straight and does not deviate from a vertical orientation. The curved shape is positioned on the right side of the vertical line and is similar in appearance to the number 3. It starts at the top, curves to the right, then descends and curves to the left, ending in a horizontal line at the bottom. The curved shape is slightly smaller in size compared to the vertical line, with the two elements aligned side by side."""
