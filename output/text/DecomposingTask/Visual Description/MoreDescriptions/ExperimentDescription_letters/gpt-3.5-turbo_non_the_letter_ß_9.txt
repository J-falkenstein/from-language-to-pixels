"""The letter ÃŸ is a distinct character used in the German language. It is composed of two curved elements. The top element resembles a lowercase 'B' with a rounded top, starting from the left side and curving to the right before curving back to the left in a smooth motion. The bottom element is a short, vertically centered line that connects to the right side of the top element, curving slightly downwards. The bottom line is positioned slightly below the midpoint of the top element."""
