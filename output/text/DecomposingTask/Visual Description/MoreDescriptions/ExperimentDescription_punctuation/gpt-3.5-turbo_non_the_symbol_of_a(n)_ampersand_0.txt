"""The ampersand symbol is characterized by two distinctive elements. It has a curved, elongated shape that resembles a lower-case letter 'e' with its top part extending towards the right. This curved element is followed by a vertical line that is aligned with the right end of the curved part. The vertical line is shorter than the curved part and extends upward, creating a visually pleasing and balanced composition. The ampersand symbol is often used to represent the conjunction 'and'."""
