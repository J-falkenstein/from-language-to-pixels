"""The symbol of an ampersand is formed by two curved lines that intersect and overlap each other. The top line starts on the left side, curves upwards and to the right, and then curves downwards and to the left. The bottom line starts on the right side, curves downwards and to the left, and then curves upwards and to the right. The bottom line is slightly longer than the top line, creating a visual balance. The two lines meet at a point near the center, forming a loop that resembles the shape of a lowercase 'e'. The overall shape of the symbol is fluid and symmetrical, with the lines flowing smoothly into each other."""
