"""The symbol of an ampersand appears as a combination of two elements. At the top, it showcases a graceful, flowing curve that starts on the left side and gently slopes to the right. This curve is followed by a vertical line that emerges from its midpoint and extends downward. The lower part of the symbol begins with a similarly curved line on the left, curving towards the right, and connecting with the vertical line at the midpoint. The resulting shape closely resembles a lowercase letter 'et' or 'et' ligature, and exhibits a harmonious balance between the curves and straight lines."""
