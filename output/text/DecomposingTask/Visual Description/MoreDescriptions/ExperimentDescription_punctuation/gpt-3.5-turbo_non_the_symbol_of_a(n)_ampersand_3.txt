"""The symbol of an ampersand (&) consists of two distinct curved elements. It resembles a lowercase letter 'e' that has been mirrored horizontally and combined with a vertical line. The vertical line runs through the middle of the letter 'e', starting at the top left and ending at the bottom right. The curved top element of the 'e' starts on the top left, curves downwards to the right, then loops back up and curves back down to connect with the vertical line. The curved bottom element of the 'e' is horizontally mirrored and starts on the bottom left, curving upwards to the left and then looping back down to connect with the vertical line."""
