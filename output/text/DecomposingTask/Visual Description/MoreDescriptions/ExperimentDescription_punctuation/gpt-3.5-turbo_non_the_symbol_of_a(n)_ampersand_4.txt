"""The ampersand symbol is formed by two curved lines intersecting at a common point. The top curve starts on the left side, swoops down to the right, and then curves back up to the left. The bottom curve starts on the right side, sweeps up to the left, and then curves back down to the right. The curves are symmetrical and the intersection of the two lines is at the center of the symbol. The overall shape is similar to a lowercase letter 'e' written in cursive, but with an additional loop on the right side."""
