"""The symbol of an ampersand is formed by two distinct curves that intersect with each other. The bottom curve starts on the left side, curves upwards and then loops back down to the right. The top curve starts on the right side, curves downwards and then loops back up to the left. The two curves intersect at a point in the middle, forming an enclosed space between them. The bottom curve is slightly larger and longer than the top curve, giving the ampersand a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The curves are smooth and flowing, without any sharp angles or corners."""
