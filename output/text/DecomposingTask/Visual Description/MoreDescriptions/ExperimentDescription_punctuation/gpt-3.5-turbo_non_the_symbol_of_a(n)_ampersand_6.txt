"""The ampersand symbol is formed by a combination of two curved elements. It begins with a vertical line that extends downward from the top, curving slightly to the left. At the bottom of this line, it smoothly transitions into a curved, horizontal element that resembles a lowercase letter 'e'. This horizontal element then curves back up to the right and continues into a second vertical line, which mirrors the first one. The two vertical lines are parallel and aligned closely together, creating a distinctive and recognizable shape."""
