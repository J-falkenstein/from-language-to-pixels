"""The symbol of a(n) ampersand looks like a combination of the letters 'e' and 't' intertwined together. It begins with a curved horizontal line that starts slightly above the baseline and curves downwards to the right. This curve then continues upwards, forming a loop that resembles the lowercase letter 'e'. From the bottom of this loop, a second curve emerges, bending upwards and to the left, resembling the letter 't'. This curve intersects with the initial curve, creating a connection between the two letters and forming the final shape of the ampersand."""
