"""The symbol of an ampersand is composed of two curved lines that intersect and overlap each other. The lines resemble the shape of a lowercase letter 's' and an upside-down lowercase letter 'r'. The upper line curves downward from left to right, then loops back up and curves to the left. The lower line curves upward from left to right, then loops back down and curves to the right. The curves of both lines intersect at a central point, forming a distinct intersection or cross-like shape."""
