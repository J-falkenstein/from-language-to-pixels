"""The symbol of an ampersand is formed by two curved lines that intersect and loop around each other. It resembles the shape of a lowercase letter 'e' that has been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, with an additional curved line extending from the bottom right of the 'e' shape. The upper curve starts on the left side, slightly curves upwards and to the left, then loops under and over the lower curve, before continuing downward and to the right. The lower curve starts on the upper right side, curves downward and to the left, loops under the upper curve, and then extends to the right in a straight line."""
