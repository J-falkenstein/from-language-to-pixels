"""The symbol of an asterisk is a star-like shape consisting of six straight lines. There are two diagonals that intersect at the center, forming an "X" shape. From each end of the diagonals, there is a short line extending outwards in each of the four cardinal directions - up, down, left, and right. The lines are equal in length and angle, creating a symmetrical appearance. The central point where all the lines meet is the focal point of the asterisk, giving it a balanced and dynamic look."""
