"""The symbol of an asterisk is composed of a set of five straight lines radiating from a central point, resembling a star. The lines are evenly spaced and extend outwards at an angle from the center. The topmost and bottommost lines are aligned in a vertical orientation, while the remaining three lines are tilted slightly to the right. The lines are all of equal length and do not intersect, creating an open and symmetrical appearance."""
