"""The asterisk symbol is formed by a central point from which six straight lines radiate outward in a star-like shape. The lines are evenly spaced, forming angles of approximately 60 degrees between each adjacent pair. The length of the lines is similar, extending about halfway between the central point and the outer edges of the symbol. The lines intersect each other at their points of origin, creating a small open space in the center of the symbol. The overall shape of the asterisk is symmetrical and balanced, with the lines extending outward in all directions."""
