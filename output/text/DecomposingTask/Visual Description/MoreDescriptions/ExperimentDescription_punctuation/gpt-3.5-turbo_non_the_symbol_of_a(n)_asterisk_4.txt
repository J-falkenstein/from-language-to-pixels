The symbol of an asterisk is formed by two intersecting lines. It looks like a star, with each line extending outwards from a central point. The vertical line is slightly longer than the horizontal line, and they intersect at a 90-degree angle. The lines are straight and evenly spaced, creating a symmetrical shape. The intersection point is in the center of the symbol, where the lines meet. The asterisk symbol has no outlined shape, but it is made up of two straight lines coming together at a point.
