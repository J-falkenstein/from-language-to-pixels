The symbol of an asterisk is a star-like shape formed by intersecting lines. It is comprised of six straight lines arranged in a radial pattern, with three lines extending outwards from a central point and three lines extending inwards towards the center. The lines are evenly spaced and intersect at points that are equidistant from each other, creating a symmetrical shape. The length of each line is typically the same, resulting in equal proportions between the arms of the asterisk. The overall shape of the asterisk can be described as a closed, compact and symmetrical star.
