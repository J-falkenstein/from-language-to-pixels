"""The symbol of an asterisk resembles a small star with multiple pointed arms. It is a symmetrical shape with each arm extending outwards from a central point. The arms are thin lines that radiate from the center, creating a star-like appearance. The length of each arm is equal, and they are evenly spaced around the central point. The overall shape is compact and visually balanced, with sharp points and clean lines."""
