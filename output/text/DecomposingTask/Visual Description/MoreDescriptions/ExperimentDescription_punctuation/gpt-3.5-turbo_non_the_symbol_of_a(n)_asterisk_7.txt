"""The symbol of an asterisk is composed of a central point that radiates six evenly spaced straight lines outward, resembling a star. The lines are all the same length and intersect at the central point. The angles between the lines are all equal, creating a symmetrical and balanced shape. The lines extend outwards in a radial pattern, giving the asterisk a sense of movement and direction."""
