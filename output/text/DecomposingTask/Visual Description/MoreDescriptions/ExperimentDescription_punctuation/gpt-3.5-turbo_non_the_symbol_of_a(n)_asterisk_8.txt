"""The symbol of an asterisk is formed by two diagonal lines that intersect each other at a central point. The lines are evenly spaced and slant in opposite directions, resembling an 'X' shape. The intersection point is precisely in the center of the symbol, forming equal angles between each line. The length of the lines is typically longer than the width of the intersection point, creating an asterisk that is elongated and symmetrical."""
