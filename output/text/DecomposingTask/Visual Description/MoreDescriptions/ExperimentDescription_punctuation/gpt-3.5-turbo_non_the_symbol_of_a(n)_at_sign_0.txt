"""The symbol @ is composed of a small circle with a curved tail extending from the top right. The circle forms the base of the symbol and is positioned slightly towards the left side. From the top right of the circle, a smooth and flowing curve protrudes, extending diagonally towards the bottom left. This curve resembles a lowercase letter 'a' without the horizontal line. It gently descends and then curls back up, resting just below the starting point of the curve. The tail does not completely encircle the circle but leaves a small opening between the starting point and ending point of the curve."""
