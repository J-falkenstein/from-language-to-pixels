"""The symbol of an at sign (@) is formed by a small circle with a looped tail. The circle is placed upright, with its top directly above its bottom. The tail originates from the upper right side of the circle, curving to the left and downward. The curve then loops back around and overlaps with the bottom portion of the circle, creating a closed, continuous loop. The overall shape can be described as a rounded, symmetrical combination of a circle and a lowercase letter 'a'."
