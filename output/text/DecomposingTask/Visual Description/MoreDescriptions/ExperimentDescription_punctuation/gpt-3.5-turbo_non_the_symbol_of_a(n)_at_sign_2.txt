"""The at sign symbol (@) is formed by a small curled loop that starts with a vertical line on the left side and curves downward to the right, forming a closed shape. The loop is then crossed by a horizontal line that is positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line. The horizontal line extends to the left and right, intersecting the loop at two points. The loop and the intersecting line create the distinct shape of the at symbol, with the loop resembling a lowercase letter 'a' and the intersecting line forming the shape of a lowercase letter 't'."""
