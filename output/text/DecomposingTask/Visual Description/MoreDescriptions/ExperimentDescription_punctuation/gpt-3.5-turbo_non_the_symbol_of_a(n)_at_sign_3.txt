"""The symbol of the at sign (@) is formed by a small circle that is intersected by a curved line. The circle is centered in the middle and serves as the body of the symbol. The curved line starts on the left side of the circle, gently curves upwards to the right, and then loops back down to the left, intersecting the circle slightly below its midpoint. The line is thicker than the circle and maintains a consistent width throughout. The upper portion of the line is shorter than the lower portion, but both align vertically with the center of the circle, creating a symmetrical appearance. The at sign is typically displayed in a vertical orientation, with the circle and line aligned along a central vertical axis."""
