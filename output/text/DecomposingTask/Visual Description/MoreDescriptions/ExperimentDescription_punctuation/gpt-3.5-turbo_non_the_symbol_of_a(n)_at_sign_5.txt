"""The symbol of the at sign (@) is composed of a small circle positioned above a slightly larger circle. The smaller circle is centered directly above the larger circle, and they touch at a single point. Both circles are fully closed and do not have any interior space. The size of the smaller circle is approximately one-third the size of the larger circle. The larger circle forms the base of the symbol, while the smaller circle rests on top, creating a stacked or vertically aligned arrangement. The at sign has a symmetrical and compact appearance, with the circles perfectly aligned vertically."""
