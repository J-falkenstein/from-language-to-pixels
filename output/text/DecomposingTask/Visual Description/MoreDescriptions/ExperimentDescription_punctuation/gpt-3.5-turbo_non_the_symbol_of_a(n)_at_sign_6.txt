"The at sign (@) is formed by a small circle above a small capital letter 'a'. The circle is positioned slightly above the middle of the 'a', with the top of the circle intersecting the middle of the letter. The circle is approximately the same size as the top curve of the 'a'. The 'a' has a triangular shape, with a diagonal line starting at the bottom left corner, curving upwards to the right and then diagonally downwards to the left. The bottom of the 'a' forms a horizontal line that connects to the bottom of the circle. The 'a' and the circle are aligned in a straight vertical orientation."
