"""The at sign, also known as '@', is a symbol that resembles a lowercase letter 'a' enclosed in a small circle. The circular shape is fully closed and symmetrical, with the 'a' shape positioned at the center. The 'a' is formed by a curved stroke that starts at the top left, moves towards the right in a downward slant, and then curves back up on the right side. The bottom part of the 'a' extends slightly below the circle, giving it a tail-like appearance."""
