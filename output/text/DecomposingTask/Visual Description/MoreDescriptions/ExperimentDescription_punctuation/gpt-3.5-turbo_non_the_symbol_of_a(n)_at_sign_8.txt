"""The at sign (@) is formed by a small circle with a tail extending from the upper right corner. The circle is relatively small, about half the size of a lowercase 'o' letter. The tail is a curved line that starts at the upper right corner of the circle and extends diagonally downward towards the right. The tail is slightly longer than the diameter of the circle, extending just past the bottom right corner. The overall shape of the at sign is similar to a lowercase letter 'a' with a curling tail, but with a closed circle instead of an open loop."""
