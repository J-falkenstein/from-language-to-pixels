"""The symbol of the at sign, or @, is formed by a small circle positioned above a slightly elongated, lowercase letter 'a'. The circle is positioned in the upper left corner of the letter 'a' and is aligned vertically with the vertical stroke of the 'a'. The circle is not fully enclosed, leaving an open space in the lower right portion. The bottom curve of the 'a' extends slightly past the circle, and the top curve of the 'a' is connected to the circle at a point that is slightly below the midpoint of the circle's left side. The at sign symbol is often used in email addresses and serves as a shorthand way to represent 'at' or 'located at' in various contexts."""
