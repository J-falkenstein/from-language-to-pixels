The backslash symbol (\) is a short, diagonal line that starts from the bottom left corner and extends upwards towards the top right corner. It is aligned diagonally and is inclined towards the upper right direction. The line is relatively short in length and forms an acute angle with the horizontal and vertical axes. The backslash has a distinct slant and does not intersect or touch any other lines or elements.
