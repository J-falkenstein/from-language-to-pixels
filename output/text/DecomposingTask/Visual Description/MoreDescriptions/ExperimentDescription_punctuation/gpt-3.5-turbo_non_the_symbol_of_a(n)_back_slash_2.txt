The symbol of a backslash (\) looks like a diagonal line that starts at the bottom left and extends upwards and towards the right. It is a straight line that slopes diagonally with a slight angle, resembling a leaning tree trunk. The line is longer than it is wide, with the top end positioned higher and to the right of the bottom end. The backslash is aligned vertically and has a consistent thickness throughout its length. It does not intersect or overlap with any other elements.
