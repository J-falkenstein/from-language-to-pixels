"""The backslash symbol (\) is a diagonal line that slopes from the top left to the bottom right. It resembles a forward slash (/) that has been turned backwards. The line is straight and has a slight incline towards the right as it descends. It is oriented in a vertical position, with the top end positioned higher than the bottom end. The backslash is typically thin and narrow, with no other distinct features or elements."""
