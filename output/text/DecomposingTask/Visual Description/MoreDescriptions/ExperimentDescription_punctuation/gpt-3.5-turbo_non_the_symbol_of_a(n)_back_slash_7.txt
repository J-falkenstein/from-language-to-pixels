The symbol for a backslash (\) is a straight line that slants diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. It creates an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the horizontal line. The line starts at the top left corner and ends at the bottom right corner. It is a single continuous line with no breaks or curves. The backslash is typically shorter in length compared to other symbols and letters on a keyboard. It is often used in computer programming and file paths to indicate directory structures.
