"The symbol of a caret is an upside-down 'V' shape. It consists of two diagonally sloping lines that meet at a point in the middle. The lines start at the top left and top right corners and slope downwards towards each other, intersecting at the center. The slope of the lines is slightly less than 45 degrees, giving the caret a narrower and more acute appearance. The bottom of the caret is open, forming a clear space between the two lines."
