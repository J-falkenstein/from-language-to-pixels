"The caret symbol is an upward-pointing triangle shape. It consists of two straight lines that meet at a single point, forming a V-like shape. The bottom line starts at the left side and extends diagonally upwards to the right, while the top line starts at the right side and extends diagonally downwards to the left. The two lines are of equal length and meet at a sharp point in the center. The caret symbol is typically used to indicate insertion points or to denote emphasis or direction."
