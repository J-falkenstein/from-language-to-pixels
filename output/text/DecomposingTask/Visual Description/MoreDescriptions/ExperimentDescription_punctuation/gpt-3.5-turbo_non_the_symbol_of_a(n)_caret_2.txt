"""The caret symbol is an arrow-like shape that points upward and to the right. It is formed by starting with a small diagonal line that slants upward from left to right, and then curving it gently to the right. The diagonal line is slightly longer than the curved portion, and together they create the distinct arrow shape of the caret symbol. The diagonal line is positioned at the bottom left of the curved portion, and they align to form a smooth and continuous shape."""
