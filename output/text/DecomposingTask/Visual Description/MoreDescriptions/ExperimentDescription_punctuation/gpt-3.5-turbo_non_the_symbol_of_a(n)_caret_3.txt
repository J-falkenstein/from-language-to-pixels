"""The symbol of a caret appears as a small, upward-pointing triangle. It consists of a single diagonal line that starts at the bottom left and slopes upwards towards the top right. The line is straight and has a consistent thickness throughout its length. The top end of the line terminates in a sharp point, creating the triangular shape. The overall size of the symbol can vary, but it typically appears smaller than other elements on a page."""
