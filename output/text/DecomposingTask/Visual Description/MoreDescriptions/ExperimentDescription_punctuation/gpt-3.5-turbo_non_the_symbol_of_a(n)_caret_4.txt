"The caret symbol is a small, upside-down 'V' shape. It consists of two diagonal lines that meet at a point, forming a sharp angle. The diagonal lines are of equal length and are aligned in an upward slanting direction. The bottom ends of the lines touch and converge to create the point of the caret."
