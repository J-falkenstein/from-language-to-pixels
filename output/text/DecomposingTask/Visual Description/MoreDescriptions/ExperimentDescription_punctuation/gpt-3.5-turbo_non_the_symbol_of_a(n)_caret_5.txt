The symbol of a caret is represented by an upward pointing triangle. The caret has three sides, two of which are straight lines that meet at a point at the top. These straight lines are parallel and symmetrical, extending vertically from the bottom to the top of the triangle. The third side is a diagonal line that starts at the bottom left corner and connects to the top point. This diagonal line is also symmetrical, forming an angle with the vertical lines. The diagonal line is shorter than the vertical lines, creating an acute angle at the top of the triangle. The horizontal line connecting the bottom left and right corners is also shorter than the vertical lines, creating acute angles at the bottom corners. The caret is usually drawn in a clear, bold manner to emphasize its shape.
