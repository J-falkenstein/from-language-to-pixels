"""The symbol of a caret is in the shape of an upward-pointing triangle. The triangle has three sides of equal length, forming a sharp point at the top. The base of the triangle is aligned horizontally. The two sides of the triangle are slanted inward towards the top point, creating a V shape. The triangle is open at the bottom, as there is no horizontal line connecting the two sides. The overall shape of the caret is symmetrical, with the point centered vertically. The length of each side of the triangle is shorter than the distance from the bottom of the triangle to the point, giving the caret a slim and elongated appearance. The proportions of the caret are balanced, with the base of the triangle being wider than the width of the sides. The caret is typically used as a punctuation mark to indicate an insertion point or to separate alternatives or options in a list."""
