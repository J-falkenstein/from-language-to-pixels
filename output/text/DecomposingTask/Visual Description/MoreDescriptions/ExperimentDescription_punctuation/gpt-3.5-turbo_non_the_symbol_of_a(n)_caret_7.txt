"""The caret symbol is an inverted 'V' shape. It consists of two straight lines that meet at a single point in the middle. The lines are aligned horizontally, with the point of the 'V' located directly in the center. The left line slants upwards from the bottom left to the center point, while the right line slants upwards from the bottom right to the same center point. The space between the two lines forms a small triangle."""
