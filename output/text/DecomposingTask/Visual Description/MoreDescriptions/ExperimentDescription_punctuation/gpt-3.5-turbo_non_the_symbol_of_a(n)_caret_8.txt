"The caret symbol is a small, upward-pointing triangle. It is similar in shape to an arrowhead, with two slanted sides converging to form a sharp point at the top. The bottom of the triangle is flat and straight, creating a horizontal line. The overall shape of the caret is symmetrical and compact, with the two slanted sides aligned evenly on both sides of the vertical line. The size of the caret can vary, but it is typically small and compact, fitting within a confined space."
