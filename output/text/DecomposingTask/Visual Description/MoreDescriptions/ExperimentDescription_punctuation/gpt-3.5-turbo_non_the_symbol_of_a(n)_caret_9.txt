"""The caret symbol is an inverted V shape with the bottom point facing upwards. It consists of two straight lines that intersect at a single point. The bottom line is shorter and forms the base of the V shape, while the top line is longer and extends diagonally upwards from the center point. The lines are aligned vertically and the top line is angled to the right, creating a slanted appearance."""
