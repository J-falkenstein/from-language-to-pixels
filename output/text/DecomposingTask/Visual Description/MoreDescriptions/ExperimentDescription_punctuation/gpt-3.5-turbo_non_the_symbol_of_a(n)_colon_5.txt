"The symbol of a colon consists of two small dots positioned vertically above each other in the center of a horizontal line. The dots are small, round, and evenly spaced, with the upper dot slightly smaller than the lower dot. They are aligned along the vertical axis and are centered horizontally within the line. The horizontal line is straight and extends evenly on each side, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The dots are positioned in the upper half of the line, with the lower dot closer to the bottom of the line than the upper dot."
