"""The symbol of a comma is a small curved mark that resembles a miniature letter 'C'. It is oriented horizontally, with the curved section facing leftward. The comma is relatively small in size and typically appears as a curved line with no additional features or embellishments. The curved section of the comma starts from the top left, curves downwards and then loops back up slightly, creating a small opening."""
