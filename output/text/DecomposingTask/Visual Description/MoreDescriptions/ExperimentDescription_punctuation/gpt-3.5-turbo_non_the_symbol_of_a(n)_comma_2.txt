"The symbol for a comma is a small curved line that starts at the top left and slopes downward and to the right. It is similar in shape to a small letter 'c', but with the opening facing towards the right. The line is smooth and continuous, without any sharp angles or breaks, and it has a gentle curve throughout its length. The comma symbol is relatively small in size, typically smaller than the letters of a word. It is often used to separate items or clauses in a sentence."
