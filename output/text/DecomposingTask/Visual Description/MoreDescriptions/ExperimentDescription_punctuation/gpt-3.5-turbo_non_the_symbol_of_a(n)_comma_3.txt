"""The symbol of a comma is a small curved shape that resembles a tiny letter 'C' or a miniature quarter circle. It is positioned vertically, with the open end facing upwards. The shape starts at the left and curves smoothly to the right, creating a small loop-like form. The comma is smaller in size compared to other symbols and is often used to indicate a pause or separation within a sentence."""
