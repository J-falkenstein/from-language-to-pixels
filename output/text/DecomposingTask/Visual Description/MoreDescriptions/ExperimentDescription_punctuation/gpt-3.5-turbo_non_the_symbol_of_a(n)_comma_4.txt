"""The symbol of a comma is a small, curved line that resembles a miniature letter 'c'. It starts at the top left and curves downward and to the right, ending in a small tail-like stroke. The curve of the comma is fluid and smooth, resembling the shape of a small, lowercase 'e'. The size of the comma is typically smaller than that of a lowercase letter, and its orientation is horizontal, with the top of the comma aligning with the baseline of the writing surface."""
