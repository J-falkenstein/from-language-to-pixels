"The comma symbol is a small curved shape that resembles a tiny sideways letter 'C'. It is formed by a short, curved line that starts on the left and curves downward, then turns sharply to the right and curves back up. The bottom end of the line is slightly higher than the starting point, creating a gentle arching shape. The comma symbol is typically smaller than other symbols or letters, and it is often used to indicate pauses or separations in written language."
