"The symbol of a comma is a small, curved line that slightly resembles a miniature snail shell. It starts at the top left with a gentle curve to the right, then continues downward with a steeper curve to the left, resembling the shape of a lowercase 'c'. The line is thin and uniform in thickness throughout its entirety."
