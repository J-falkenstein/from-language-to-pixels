"The symbol of a dollar sign ($) is composed of a vertical line with two horizontal lines intersecting it. The vertical line is longer and positioned slightly to the left side of the horizontal lines. The top horizontal line is shorter and angled diagonally, sloping upwards from left to right. The bottom horizontal line is longer and angled diagonally in the opposite direction, sloping downwards from left to right. The two horizontal lines are parallel to each other and intersect the vertical line at the center point. The top horizontal line begins slightly below the top of the vertical line and ends slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line, while the bottom horizontal line starts slightly above the bottom of the vertical line and extends slightly below the midpoint of the vertical line. The dollar sign has a distinctive curved shape, resembling an 'S' with two lines intersecting it."
