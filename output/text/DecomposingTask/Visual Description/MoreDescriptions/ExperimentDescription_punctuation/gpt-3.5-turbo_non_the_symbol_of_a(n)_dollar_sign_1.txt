"""The dollar sign symbol ($) is comprised of two vertical lines that are slightly angled to the right. The top line is shorter than the bottom line. Starting from the top of the vertical lines, there are two horizontal lines that are parallel to each other. The top line is shorter and positioned slightly higher than the bottom line. The horizontal lines intersect the vertical lines at the same point, creating a distinctive 'S' shape. The top and bottom ends of the 'S' shape are slightly curved, giving the symbol a flowing and dynamic appearance. Overall, the symbol has a compact and symmetrical design, with the vertical lines serving as the main framework for the 'S' shape."""
