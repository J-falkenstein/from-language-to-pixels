The dollar sign symbol ($) is formed by two horizontal lines that intersect at a slight angle. The top line is shorter and positioned slightly above the longer bottom line. The top line starts on the left side, extends to the right, and then curves downward and to the left, intersecting with the longer bottom line slightly below its midpoint. The longer bottom line starts on the left side, extends horizontally to the right, and then curves upward and to the right, meeting the top line at the intersection point. The intersection forms a sharp point at the center of the symbol. The overall shape of the dollar sign resembles an uppercase letter 'S' with two lines crossing through it, creating an enclosed loop at the lower end of the top line.
