"The dollar sign symbol ($) is formed by two vertical lines, placed closely together and parallel to each other. They are connected at the top by a horizontal line, creating a rectangular shape. Inside the top half of the rectangle, there is a slightly curved vertical line that starts at the left side, slants downward towards the right, and then curves upward again to the left. This curved line is a bit shorter than the height of the rectangle. At the bottom half of the rectangle, there is another slightly curved vertical line that starts at the left side, slants downward towards the right, and then curves upward to the right side. This curved line is slightly longer than the height of the rectangle. Overall, the dollar sign symbol has a rectangular shape with two vertical lines connected by a horizontal line, and the distinctive feature is the presence of the two curved lines within the rectangle."
