The symbol of a dollar sign ($) is a combination of two distinct elements. It starts with a vertical line that slants slightly to the right, angling downwards from left to right. The line is relatively short in length. At the bottom right end of the line, a horizontal line extends to the right in a straight manner. This line is longer than the vertical line. Near the midpoint of the horizontal line, a small loop or curve is formed, turning upwards and bending back towards the left. This loop or curve is open towards the top and does not connect with any other lines. The overall shape of the dollar sign is reminiscent of an 'S' with a vertical line through the middle.
