"""The symbol of a dollar sign ($) is comprised of two S-like curves that are vertically aligned and stacked on top of each other. The top curve is larger and starts on the left side, curving upwards and then returning to the right side, forming a loop. The bottom curve is smaller and mirrors the shape of the top curve, starting on the right side, curving downwards and then returning to the left side. The two curves are connected in the middle by a vertical straight line that serves as the stem of the dollar sign. The overall shape of the symbol is reminiscent of a twisted ribbon or a snake-like figure."""
