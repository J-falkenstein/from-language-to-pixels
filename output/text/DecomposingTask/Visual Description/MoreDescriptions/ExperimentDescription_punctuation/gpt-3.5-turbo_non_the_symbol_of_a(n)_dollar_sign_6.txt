"""The symbol of a dollar sign ($) is composed of two distinct elements. The first element is a vertical line that starts at the bottom and extends upwards, slightly curving to the right. This line is taller than the second element. The second element is a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line approximately two-thirds of the way up. It starts on the left side of the vertical line, curves downwards to the right, and then forms a small loop before curving upwards to the left. This loop serves as a connector between the two lines. The vertical and horizontal lines are aligned in a straight, vertical orientation, creating a distinct shape that is recognizable as the symbol of a dollar sign."""
