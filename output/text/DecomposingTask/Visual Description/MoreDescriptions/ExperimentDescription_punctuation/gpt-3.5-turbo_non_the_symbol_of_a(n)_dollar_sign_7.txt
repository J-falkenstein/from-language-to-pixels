The dollar sign is a symbol that resembles the letter "S" with two vertical lines running through it. It is typically written with a slightly slanted, elongated shape. The top part of the "S" curves downward to form a loop, while the bottom part curves upward to create a smaller loop. The two loops are connected by a straight, vertical line that runs through the center of the symbol. The top loop is larger and more rounded, while the bottom loop is smaller and slightly squarer in shape. The vertical lines run parallel to each other and are equidistant from the edges of the loops. The overall shape of the dollar sign is symmetrical, with the loops and lines aligned along a central axis.
