"""The dollar sign symbol consists of a vertical line with a horizontal line crossing it near the top. The vertical line is slightly longer than the horizontal line. The horizontal line has two small vertical lines extending from its ends, pointing towards the center. The top end of the vertical line is aligned with the middle of the horizontal line, creating a distinct 'S' shape."""
