"""The dollar sign is an intricate symbol that consists of two parallel, vertical lines with a slightly tapered, curved line intersecting them in the middle. The parallel lines are of equal length and are positioned vertically, with the curved line crossing them diagonally from left to right. The curved line starts slightly below the top of the parallel lines and curves inward towards the right, forming a loop. The bottom end of the curved line extends slightly below the parallel lines, creating a tail-like shape. The overall shape of the dollar sign is reminiscent of the letter 'S', but with more complexity and embellishments."""
