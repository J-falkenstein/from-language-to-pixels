The symbol for a double quote consists of two vertical lines that are parallel to each other. The lines are of equal length and are aligned vertically. They are typically positioned next to a word or phrase to indicate that it is being quoted or referenced. The lines are straight and perpendicular to the baseline of the text. They do not intersect or touch any other elements on the page. The space between the two lines is typically empty, forming a clear, open space between them.
