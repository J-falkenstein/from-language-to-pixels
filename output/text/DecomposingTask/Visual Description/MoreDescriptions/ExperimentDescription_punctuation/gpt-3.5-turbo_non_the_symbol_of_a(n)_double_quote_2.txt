The symbol of a double quote consists of two vertical lines that are parallel to each other. The lines are of equal length and are aligned in a straight vertical orientation. They are typically positioned close together, with no gap in between. Each line is straight and does not have any curves or bends. The lines are also typically thin and have no distinctive features or patterns on them. The double quote symbol is often used in writing to indicate dialogue or a quotation.
