"The double quote symbol consists of two horizontal lines that are parallel to each other and spaced closely together. Both lines are of equal length, extending from left to right. They are aligned perfectly in the center, creating a vertical symmetry. The lines are straight and do not have any curves or angles. The space between the lines is typically empty and open, forming a clear, unobstructed space."
