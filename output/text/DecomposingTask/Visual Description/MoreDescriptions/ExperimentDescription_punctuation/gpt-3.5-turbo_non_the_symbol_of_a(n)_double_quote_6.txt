"The symbol of a double quote consists of two vertical, parallel lines that are aligned vertically. Each line is of equal length and extends in a straight, vertical orientation. The lines are positioned close together, almost touching, to indicate the start and end of a quotation or dialogue. They do not intersect or overlap, maintaining a consistent width throughout. The lines are typically thin and straight, lacking any additional curves or embellishments."
