"The symbol of a double quote consists of two vertically aligned straight lines that are parallel to each other. The top line is shorter than the bottom line, and they are connected at their ends by two small horizontal lines. The vertical lines are aligned in a straight vertical orientation, with the top line positioned slightly higher than the bottom line. The symbol may be hollow or filled, depending on the context in which it is used."
