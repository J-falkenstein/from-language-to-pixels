The symbol of a double quote consists of two parallel, vertical lines that are slightly longer than they are wide. The lines are positioned side by side, with a small horizontal space in between them. Both lines are straight and aligned vertically. They are typically equal in length and width, creating a symmetrical appearance. The double quote symbol represents the opening and closing of a quotation or a direct speech.
