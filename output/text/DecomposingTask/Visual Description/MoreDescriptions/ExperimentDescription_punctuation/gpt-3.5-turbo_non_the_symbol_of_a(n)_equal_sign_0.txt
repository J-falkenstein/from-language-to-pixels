The equal sign is a simple and symmetrical symbol that represents mathematical equivalence. It consists of two horizontal lines of equal length that are aligned perfectly parallel to each other. The lines are typically straight and centered vertically. The spaces above and below the lines are empty, creating a clear and open space between them. The equal sign does not have any distinctive curves or angles and is often used to indicate that two quantities or expressions on either side are equivalent in value.
