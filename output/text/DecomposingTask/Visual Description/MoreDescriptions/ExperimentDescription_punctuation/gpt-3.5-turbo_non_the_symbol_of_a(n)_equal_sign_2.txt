"The equal sign is a straight horizontal line that is parallel to the ground. It is positioned in the middle of the page, with equal distances from the top and bottom edges. The line is long and extends from the left side to the right side of the page, maintaining a consistent width throughout its length. The line does not slope or bend, but remains perfectly straight, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The equal sign represents equality or equivalence, with both sides having the same value or meaning."
