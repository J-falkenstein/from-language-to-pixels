The equal sign symbol consists of two parallel horizontal lines that are the same length and evenly aligned. The lines are straight and do not intersect. The top line is positioned slightly above the bottom line, creating a gap between them. The lengths of the lines are relatively large compared to their width, giving the equal sign a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The two lines represent the concept of equality, indicating that the values on either side of the sign are equivalent.
