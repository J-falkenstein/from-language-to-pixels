The equal sign is a simple symbol consisting of two parallel horizontal lines that are of equal length. The lines are aligned vertically, and there is a small space between them, creating a clear separation. The lines are straight and do not curve or intersect with any other lines or shapes. The equal sign is typically positioned in a straight, horizontal orientation. The length of the lines may vary depending on the font or style, but they should always maintain equal lengths to represent the concept of equality accurately.
