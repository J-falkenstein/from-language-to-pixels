"The symbol of an exclamation point consists of a vertical line with a small dot directly above it. The vertical line is straight and extends from the baseline upward, while the dot hovers just above the top end of the line. The dot is smaller in size compared to the vertical line, and they are aligned in a straight vertical orientation. The dot is positioned directly above the top end of the line, creating a clear and distinct separation between the two elements."
