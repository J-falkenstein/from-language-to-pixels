"""The exclamation point symbol is a vertical line with a small dot placed directly above it. The vertical line is straight and extends from the bottom to the top of the symbol, while the dot is positioned exactly in the middle of the vertical line. The dot is smaller in size compared to the length of the line, serving as a clear and distinct indicator at the top of the vertical line."""
