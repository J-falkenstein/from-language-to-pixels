"""The exclamation point symbol is represented by a vertical line with a small dot directly above it. The vertical line is longer than the dot, extending downwards from the dot's center. The line is straight and aligned vertically, while the dot is circular and aligned directly above the line's top edge. The dot is positioned slightly higher than the middle of the line, creating a noticeable gap between the dot and the line. The dot is smaller in size compared to the length of the line, but still prominent in relation to the overall symbol."""
