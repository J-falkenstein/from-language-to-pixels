"""The symbol of an exclamation point is made up of two distinct elements. At the top, there is a small dot or point that is aligned vertically with the bottom element. The bottom element is a straight vertical line that is slightly longer than the dot at the top. The dot sits directly on top of the vertical line at their intersecting point, creating a clear and crisp alignment. The dot and the vertical line are the only elements present in the symbol, with no other embellishments or additional shapes."""
