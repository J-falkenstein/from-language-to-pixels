"""The symbol of an exclamation point is a vertical line with a small, horizontal line at the top. The vertical line is straight, extending from the bottom to the top of the symbol. The horizontal line is located at the top of the vertical line and is shorter in length. It is aligned perpendicular to the vertical line, creating a distinct right angle between the two lines. The horizontal line is positioned slightly above the midpoint of the vertical line, giving the symbol a sense of balance and emphasis. Together, the vertical and horizontal lines form an exclamation point shape, conveying a strong visual cue for excitement or emphasis."""
