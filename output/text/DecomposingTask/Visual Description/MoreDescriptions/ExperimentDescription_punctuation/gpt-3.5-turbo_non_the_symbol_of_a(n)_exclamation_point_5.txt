"The symbol of an exclamation point is composed of a vertical line with a small dot positioned directly above it. The vertical line is longer than the dot, extending from the bottom to the top. The dot is positioned just above the upper end of the vertical line, appearing like it is floating slightly above it. The dot is significantly smaller in size compared to the length of the line, creating a noticeable contrast between the two elements."
