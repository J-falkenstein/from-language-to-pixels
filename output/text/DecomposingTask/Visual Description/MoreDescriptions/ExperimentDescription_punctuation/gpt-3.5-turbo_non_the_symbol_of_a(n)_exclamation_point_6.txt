"The symbol of an exclamation point consists of a vertical line with a small dot directly above it. The vertical line is perfectly straight and extends from the bottom to the top of the symbol. It is slightly longer than the dot, which is positioned directly above the top end of the line. The dot appears as a small, solid circle, and it is centered horizontally with respect to the line."
