The symbol of an exclamation point is a vertical line with a small, round dot positioned directly above it. The vertical line is longer than the dot, extending upwards from the bottom. The dot is centered, directly above the top end of the vertical line. Both the dot and the vertical line are aligned vertically and in a straight orientation. The dot is small and circular, while the vertical line is longer and thinner, giving the appearance of emphasis or exclamation. The dot is positioned relatively close to the vertical line, with a small gap separating the two elements.
