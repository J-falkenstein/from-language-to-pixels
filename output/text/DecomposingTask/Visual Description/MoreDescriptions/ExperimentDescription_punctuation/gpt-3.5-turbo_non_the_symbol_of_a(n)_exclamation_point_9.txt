"The symbol of an exclamation point is a vertical line with a dot positioned directly above it. The line is straight and extends from the bottom to the top of the symbol, while the dot is a small round shape positioned directly above the upper end of the line. The dot is smaller than the line and centered above it, creating a distinct and noticeable contrast in size."
