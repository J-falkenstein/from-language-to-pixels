"""The greater than sign is a symbol that resembles an arrow pointing to the right. It consists of a diagonal line that starts at the top left corner and slants downward to the bottom right corner. The line is straight and slopes at a slight angle. At the end of the line, there is a small horizontal line that extends to the right, perpendicular to the diagonal line. The horizontal line is shorter in length compared to the diagonal line, creating the arrow-like appearance. The greater than sign is typically open on the left side, with no additional lines or shapes within it."""
