"""The greater than sign is a geometric symbol that resembles an arrow pointing to the right. It is composed of a horizontal line that is slightly curved upwards at the right end. The line is positioned at a slight angle, starting from the bottom left and extending towards the upper right. The end of the line tapers to a point, creating a sharp edge. The overall shape of the symbol is triangular, with the widest part at the left and narrowing as it moves to the right."""
