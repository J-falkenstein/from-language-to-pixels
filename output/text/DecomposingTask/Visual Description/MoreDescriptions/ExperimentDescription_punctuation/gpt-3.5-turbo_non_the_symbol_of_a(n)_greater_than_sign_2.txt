"""The symbol of a greater than sign is a diagonal line that slopes from the top left to the bottom right. The line starts at the top left corner and gradually slants downwards to the bottom right corner. It is longer on the right side and shorter on the left side, creating a pointed arrow shape. The line is thick and solid, with no breaks or interruptions. The greater than sign is positioned diagonally, with the top left corner aligned with the top edge of the page and the bottom right corner aligned with the bottom edge of the page. The symbol represents a forward or rightward direction, indicating that one value is larger or more significant than another."""
