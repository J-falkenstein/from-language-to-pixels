"The symbol of a greater than sign resembles an arrow pointing to the right. It consists of a vertical line that is slightly tilted to the right. At the top of the line, there is a half triangle that extends to the right, with its right side parallel to the line. The line and the triangle are aligned vertically, with the bottom of the triangle touching the line at the right end. The triangle is open on the left side, creating a clear, empty space between the line and the triangle."
