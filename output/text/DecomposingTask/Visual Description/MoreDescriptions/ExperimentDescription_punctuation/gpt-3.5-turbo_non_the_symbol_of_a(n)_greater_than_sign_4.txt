"The symbol of a greater than sign is represented by a diagonal line that slants from the top left to the bottom right. The line begins at a point slightly above and to the left of the center, then extends downward and to the right. It is longer than the horizontal line that represents an equal sign. The diagonal line is completely straight and does not curve or bend in any way. It aligns with the vertical line of the equal sign, creating a clear distinction between the two elements. The greater than sign is typically drawn with a gap between the diagonal line and the horizontal line, indicating that the value on the left side of the symbol is larger than the value on the right side."
