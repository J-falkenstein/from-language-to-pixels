"""The greater than sign is a symbol that resembles an arrow pointing to the right. It is composed of a horizontal line at the bottom, followed by a diagonal line that starts at the bottom left and goes upwards towards the top right. The diagonal line is longer than the horizontal line and intersects it closer to the right end. The lines are aligned in a straight vertical orientation, with the diagonal line slanted towards the right."""
