"""The greater than sign is a symbol that resembles an arrow pointing to the right. The shape consists of a long horizontal line at the bottom, followed by a shorter diagonal line that starts at the right end of the horizontal line and slants upwards towards the left. The diagonal line is angled at an approximately 45-degree angle. The top end of the diagonal line is open, forming a clear space between the diagonal line and the horizontal line below it."""
