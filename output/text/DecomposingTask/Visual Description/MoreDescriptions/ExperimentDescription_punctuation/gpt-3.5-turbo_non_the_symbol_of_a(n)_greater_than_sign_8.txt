"""The symbol of a greater than sign represents an arrow pointing towards the right. It consists of a straight horizontal line that starts on the left and extends to the right. At the end of the line, there is a triangular shape that points towards the right. The triangular shape is wider at the base and tapers to a point, creating a clear arrowhead. The arrowhead is situated above the horizontal line and is aligned with its right end. The overall shape of the greater than sign is open and asymmetrical, with the arrowhead extending beyond the line."""
