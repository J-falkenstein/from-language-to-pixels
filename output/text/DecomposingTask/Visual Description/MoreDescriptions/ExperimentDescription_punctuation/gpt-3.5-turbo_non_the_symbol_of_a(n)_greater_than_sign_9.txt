The symbol for a greater than sign is an angular shape resembling an arrow pointing to the right. It consists of a vertical line on the left side that is slightly longer than the horizontal line on the right side. The lines meet at a sharp point, forming an acute angle. The vertical line is positioned to the left of the horizontal line, with both lines aligned in a straight orientation. The greater than sign has a distinct triangular shape, with the point of the arrow indicating the direction of being "greater than."
