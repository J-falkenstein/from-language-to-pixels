"The symbol of a hashtag, also known as a pound sign or number sign, is composed of two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. The lines intersect at right angles, forming a grid-like structure. The top horizontal line is shorter than the bottom horizontal line, and the two vertical lines are equal in length. The vertical lines are aligned with the outer edges of the horizontal lines, extending upwards and downwards. The hashtag symbol is typically symmetrical and evenly spaced, with equal gaps between the lines."
