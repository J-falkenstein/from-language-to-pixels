"The symbol of a hashtag consists of two sets of parallel lines that intersect at a right angle. The vertical set of lines is longer and positioned in the center, while the horizontal set of lines is shorter and positioned towards the top and bottom of the vertical lines. The intersection of the lines creates four equal quadrants. The lines are evenly spaced and straight, forming a grid-like pattern."
