"""The symbol of a hashtag is comprised of two pairs of parallel lines that intersect each other at right angles, forming a grid-like pattern. There are four lines in total, with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. The horizontal lines are longer than the vertical lines, extending beyond the intersection point. The lines are evenly spaced and have the same width. The intersection point is in the center of the symbol, where the lines meet at a perpendicular angle."""
