The symbol of a hashtag consists of two sets of parallel horizontal lines that intersect with two sets of parallel vertical lines, creating a grid-like structure. The horizontal lines are evenly spaced and aligned horizontally, while the vertical lines are evenly spaced and aligned vertically. The intersecting points of the horizontal and vertical lines create a series of small squares within the grid. The hashtag symbol is typically symmetrical, with the horizontal and vertical lines of equal length. The lines are straight and extend from the edges of the symbol, forming a distinct, sharp outline. The grid-like structure is open, with no shading or filling, allowing the intersecting lines to stand out.
