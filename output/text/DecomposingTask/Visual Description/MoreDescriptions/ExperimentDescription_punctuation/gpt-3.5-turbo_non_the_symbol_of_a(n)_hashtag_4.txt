"The symbol of a hashtag is formed by two pairs of parallel lines, one horizontal and one vertical, intersecting each other at a right angle in the center. The horizontal lines are positioned at the top and bottom, while the vertical lines are placed on the left and right sides. All four lines are of equal length and thickness, creating a symmetrical appearance. The intersection point where the lines meet is located at the exact center of the symbol. The lines are straight and do not have any curves or angles. The hashtag symbol can be thought of as a grid or a tic-tac-toe board, with each line extending from one edge of the symbol to the opposite edge."
