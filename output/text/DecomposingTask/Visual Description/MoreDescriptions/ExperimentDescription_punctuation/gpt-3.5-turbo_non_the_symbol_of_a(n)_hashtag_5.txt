The symbol of a hashtag is composed of two sets of parallel lines, one horizontal and one vertical, intersecting each other. The horizontal lines are positioned vertically, with an equal amount of space between each line, creating a grid-like pattern. The vertical lines are positioned horizontally, with the same spacing between each line. The intersection point of the horizontal and vertical lines is at the center of the symbol. All the lines in the symbol are of equal length and thickness. The symbol forms a square shape, with the lines extending beyond the square to create equal margins on all sides. The hashtag symbol is typically open, meaning there is space between the lines, and the intersections are not filled.
