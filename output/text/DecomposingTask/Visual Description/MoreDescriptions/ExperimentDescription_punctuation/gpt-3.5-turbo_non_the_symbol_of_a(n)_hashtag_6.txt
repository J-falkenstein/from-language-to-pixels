"""The symbol of a hashtag, also known as a pound sign, is composed of two sets of parallel lines that intersect at right angles, creating a grid-like formation. One set of lines runs vertically, while the other set runs horizontally. The vertical lines are evenly spaced and extend from the top to the bottom of the symbol. The horizontal lines are also evenly spaced and extend from the left to the right of the symbol. The intersection point of the lines occurs at the center of the symbol, creating four quadrants of equal size. The horizontal and vertical lines have no distinctive thickness, making them uniformly thin throughout the symbol. The lines appear straight and perpendicular to each other, forming a balanced and symmetrical composition."""
