"""The symbol of a hashtag, also known as a pound sign or number sign, is a grid-like arrangement of horizontal and vertical lines. It is formed by two horizontal lines that are parallel to each other and intersected by two vertical lines that are also parallel to each other. The horizontal lines are slightly longer than the vertical lines, creating a rectangular shape. The vertical lines are evenly spaced and aligned with the outer edges of the horizontal lines, forming a perfect grid. The symbol is typically upright and symmetrical, with each line intersecting at a right angle, creating equal-sized squares within the grid."""
