"""The symbol of a hashtag appears as a grid of two sets of parallel lines that intersect each other at a 90-degree angle. The lines are equal in length and thickness, creating a symmetrical appearance. There are four horizontal lines and four vertical lines, resulting in a total of eight line segments. The top two horizontal lines are aligned and parallel to each other, while the bottom two horizontal lines are also aligned and parallel. Similarly, the left two vertical lines are aligned and parallel, and the right two vertical lines are aligned and parallel. The intersection point of the lines is centered within the overall shape of the hashtag. Each line segment extends to meet the adjacent line segment, creating a clean and proportional grid-like structure."""
