The symbol of a hashtag, also known as a pound sign or number sign, is represented by two parallel horizontal lines intersected by two parallel vertical lines of equal length. The horizontal lines are positioned at the top and bottom, while the vertical lines are placed on the left and right sides. The four lines meet at their ends, forming a symmetrical grid shape. All the lines are straight and have the same width. The vertical lines are perpendicular to the horizontal lines, creating right angles where they intersect. The hashtag symbol does not have any curves or diagonals, and its overall shape is square.
