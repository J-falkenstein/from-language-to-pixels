"The symbol of a left bracket is a vertical line with a small horizontal line sticking out on the right side. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line and is placed perpendicular to it. The vertical line starts at the top and extends downwards, while the horizontal line juts out to the right, usually at a right angle to the vertical line."
