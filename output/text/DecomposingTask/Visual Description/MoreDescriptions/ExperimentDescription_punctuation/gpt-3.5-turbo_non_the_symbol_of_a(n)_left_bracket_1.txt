"The symbol of a left bracket appears as a vertical line that extends downward from a horizontal line. The horizontal line is positioned slightly above the center of the vertical line, creating a small gap between the two lines. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, reaching a length approximately three times its width. The ends of the horizontal line are aligned with the edges of the vertical line, resulting in a symmetrical appearance. The overall shape of the left bracket is reminiscent of a lowercase letter 'L' with a longer vertical line."
