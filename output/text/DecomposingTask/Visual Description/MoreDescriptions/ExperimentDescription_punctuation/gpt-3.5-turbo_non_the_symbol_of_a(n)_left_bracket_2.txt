"""The symbol of a left bracket resembles a vertical line that is slightly curved inwards at the top. It is positioned on the left side and is open on the right side. The vertical line extends from the top to the bottom and is perpendicular to the ground. The curvature at the top is gentle and smooth, creating a soft curve rather than a sharp angle."""
