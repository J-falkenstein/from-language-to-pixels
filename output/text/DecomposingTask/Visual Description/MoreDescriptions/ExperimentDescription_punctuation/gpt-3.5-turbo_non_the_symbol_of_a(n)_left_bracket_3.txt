"The symbol of a left bracket resembles a vertical line that extends from top to bottom. At the top of the line, there is a small horizontal line that extends to the right, perpendicular to the vertical line. The horizontal line is positioned slightly below the top of the vertical line. The vertical line and the horizontal line are aligned vertically. The space between the two lines is empty, forming an open space within the bracket. The vertical line is slightly longer than the horizontal line."
