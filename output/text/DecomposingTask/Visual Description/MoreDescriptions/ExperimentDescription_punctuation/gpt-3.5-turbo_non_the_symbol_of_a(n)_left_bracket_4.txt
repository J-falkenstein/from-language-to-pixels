"The left bracket symbol is a vertical line that is bent at a right angle to the left. It starts at the top with a short horizontal line and then extends downwards with a longer vertical line. The top horizontal line is aligned with the bottom of the vertical line, creating a closed L-shape. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line. Overall, the left bracket symbol appears as a tall, vertical shape with a distinct right angle at the top."
