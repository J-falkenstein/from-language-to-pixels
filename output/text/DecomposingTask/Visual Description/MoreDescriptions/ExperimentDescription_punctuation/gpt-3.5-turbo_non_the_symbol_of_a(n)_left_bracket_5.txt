"The symbol of a left bracket resembles a vertical line that is slightly longer than it is wide. It is positioned with its bottom end aligned with the baseline of the drawing, and its top end extends slightly above the baseline. The sides of the bracket are parallel, creating a straight and vertical shape. The bracket has no distinct features or embellishments, and its interior is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the shape."
