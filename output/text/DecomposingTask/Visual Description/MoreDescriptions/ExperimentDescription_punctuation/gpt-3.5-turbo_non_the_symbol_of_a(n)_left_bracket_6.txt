"The left bracket symbol is composed of a vertical line that is curved towards the right at its top end. The top end of the vertical line is slightly longer than the bottom end. The curve starts at the upper left side of the vertical line and gradually extends to the right, forming a gentle, smooth arc. The vertical line and the curve are connected seamlessly, creating a continuous, flowing shape. The left bracket symbol is commonly used to indicate the beginning or opening of a group or set."
