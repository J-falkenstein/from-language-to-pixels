"The left bracket symbol is a vertical line that is slightly taller than it is wide. It is open on the right side and has a horizontal line at the bottom, which is shorter than the vertical line. The vertical line is aligned with the left side of the horizontal line, creating a right-angle shape. The vertical line extends upward, tapering slightly towards the top."
