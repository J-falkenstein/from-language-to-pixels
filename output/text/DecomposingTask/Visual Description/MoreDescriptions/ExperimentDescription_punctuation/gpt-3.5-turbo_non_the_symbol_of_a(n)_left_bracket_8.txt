The symbol of a left bracket is composed of a straight vertical line that extends downwards from a horizontal starting point. The horizontal line is placed at the top left corner of the vertical line and extends to the right, appearing shorter in length than the vertical line. The horizontal line is aligned perfectly with the top of the vertical line, forming a perpendicular angle. The vertical line continues downward below the horizontal line, ending at a point lower than the horizontal line. The overall shape of the left bracket resembles the letter "L" turned counterclockwise 90 degrees. The spaces within the bracket are typically left open and empty.
