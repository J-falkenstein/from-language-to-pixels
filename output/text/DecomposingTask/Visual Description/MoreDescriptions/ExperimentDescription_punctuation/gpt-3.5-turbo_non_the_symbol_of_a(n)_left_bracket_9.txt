"The symbol of a left bracket resembles a straight vertical line that is open on the right side. The line starts at the top and extends downwards, occupying a significant portion of the vertical space. It is aligned with the left edge of the drawing or text, leaving space to the right for additional elements. The left bracket does not have any distinctive features or proportions other than its characteristic verticality and open right side."
