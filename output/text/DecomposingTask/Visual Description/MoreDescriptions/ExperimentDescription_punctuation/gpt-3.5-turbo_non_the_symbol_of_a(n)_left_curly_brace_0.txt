The symbol of a left curly brace is a curved shape resembling the top half of a closed parenthesis "(". It is similar to an elongated letter 'C' that starts from the upper left and curves downward and to the right, ending at a slight angle. The top and bottom of the curve are parallel to each other, creating a horizontal alignment. The curve is continuous and smooth, without any breaks or sharp angles. It is larger in size compared to other symbols and is typically used to indicate the beginning of a set or group of items in mathematical or programming contexts.
