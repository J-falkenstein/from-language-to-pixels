The symbol of a left curly brace is a curved shape resembling the letter "C" with an additional vertical line extending from its top. Starting from the left, the shape curves to the right in a smooth arc, resembling a rounded corner. The curved portion continues downwards, gradually bending to the left, resembling the shape of a half circle or a parenthesis. At the bottom, a straight vertical line extends downwards from the midpoint of the curve, forming a slight angle with the curved portion. The vertical line aligns with the left edge of the curved shape, creating a clear and distinct intersection. The overall shape appears open and allows for empty space within its boundaries. The left curly brace is often used to indicate the beginning of a group or set in written or mathematical expressions.
