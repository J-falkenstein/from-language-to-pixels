"""The symbol of a left curly brace consists of a vertical line that starts at the top and extends downwards, slightly curving to the right. At the top left corner of the vertical line, there is a small curve that extends to the left. The vertical line is longer than the curve and the curve is positioned slightly above the middle of the vertical line. Together, they form an open, spacious shape that resembles a backward 'C' with a long vertical line attached at its right side."""
