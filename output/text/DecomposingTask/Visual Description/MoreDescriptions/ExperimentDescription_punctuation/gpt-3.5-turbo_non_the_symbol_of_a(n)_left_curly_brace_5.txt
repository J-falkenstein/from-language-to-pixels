The symbol of a left curly brace resembles a curved, open shape that is similar to a lowercase letter 'c'. It starts at the top left corner and curves downward in a smooth and continuous arc, reaching its lowest point on the left side. The top of the brace is slightly shorter than the bottom, creating a noticeable asymmetry in its shape. The open space within the brace is empty, allowing for clear visibility of what is enclosed by the brace. The left side of the brace is aligned vertically, while the right side is open and unattached, creating an open-ended form.
