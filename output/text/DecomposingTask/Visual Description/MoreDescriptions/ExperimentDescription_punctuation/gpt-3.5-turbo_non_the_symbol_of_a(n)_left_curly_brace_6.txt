The symbol of a left curly brace is a curved figure that resembles a lowercase letter "c" that has been stretched vertically. It starts with a straight vertical line on the left side, then curves outward to the right halfway up, resembling an open parenthesis. The curve continues downward and curls back inwards, creating an elongated curved shape. The top and bottom of the curve align horizontally, creating a concave shape in the middle. The space inside the curve is typically empty, forming an open area within the shape. The left curly brace is typically positioned to the left of other symbols or objects and can be used to enclose or group elements together.
