"""The symbol of a left curly brace looks like an elongated, curved shape that resembles a backwards letter 'C' or a partially opened parenthesis. It starts with a short vertical line on the left side, then curves outward in a smooth, flowing motion. The top of the curve is taller than the bottom, creating a sense of asymmetry. The overall shape is open on the right side, leaving a clear, empty space within the curved area."""
