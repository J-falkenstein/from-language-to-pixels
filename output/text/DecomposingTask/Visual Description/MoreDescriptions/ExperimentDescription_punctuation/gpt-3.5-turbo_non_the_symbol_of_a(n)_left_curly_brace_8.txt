The symbol of a left curly brace resembles a curved line that starts at the upper left side, curves down to the right, and then curves back up to the left. It is somewhat similar to the shape of a lowercase letter "J" but with a larger curve. The top part of the curve is aligned horizontally with the bottom part, creating an open space in the middle. The curve is smooth and continuous, without any sharp angles or breaks. Its overall shape is similar to a semicircle with one end elongated and curved inward.
