The symbol of a left curly brace looks like a backwards letter "C" that is elongated and curved. It starts with a small straight horizontal line at the top left, then curves downward and to the right, gradually getting longer as it curves. The curve ends at the bottom, forming a large opening facing to the left. The overall shape is similar to a rounded hook or the shape of a half moon. The top part of the curve is relatively small in comparison to the bottom part, and the curve is smooth and continuous. The left curly brace is typically used in mathematical equations or expressions to group or enclose sets of elements.
