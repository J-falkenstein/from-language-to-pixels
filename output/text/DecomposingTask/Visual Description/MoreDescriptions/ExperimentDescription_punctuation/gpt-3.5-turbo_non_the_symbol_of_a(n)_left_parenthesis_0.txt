The symbol of a left parenthesis resembles a curved line that is open on the right side. It starts at the top with a small curve to the left, then continues with a larger curve to the right, curving downwards towards the bottom. The top and bottom parts of the curved line are aligned horizontally. The open right side creates an empty space, leaving the right end of the curved line disconnected.
