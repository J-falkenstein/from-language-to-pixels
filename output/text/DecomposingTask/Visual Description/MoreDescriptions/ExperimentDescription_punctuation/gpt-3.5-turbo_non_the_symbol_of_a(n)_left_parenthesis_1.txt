"The left parenthesis symbol is an open curved shape resembling a half circle, but with its ends slightly tapered inward. The curved shape starts from the left side and smoothly curves upwards, leaving an open space on the right side. The inner and outer edges of the curved shape are parallel to each other, creating a uniform width throughout. The open space within the curved shape is empty, allowing for separation or grouping of elements within the context it is used."
