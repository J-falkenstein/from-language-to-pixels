"""The left parenthesis symbol is a curved shape that resembles the letter 'C' rotated 90 degrees clockwise. It starts at the top with a rounded curve that dips down towards the center, then continues with a smaller rounded curve that rises back up towards the center. The two curves are interconnected smoothly, creating an open space on the right side of the shape. The overall form is symmetrical and the curved lines flow gracefully without any sharp angles or corners."""
