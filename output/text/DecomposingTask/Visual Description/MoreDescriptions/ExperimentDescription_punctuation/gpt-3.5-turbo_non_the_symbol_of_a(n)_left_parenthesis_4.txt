The symbol of a left parenthesis is a curved shape resembling a half-circle that is open on the right side. The top and bottom of the curve are aligned horizontally, with the curve extending downwards from the top. The left side of the curve is smooth and follows a gentle arc. The shape does not contain any straight lines and has a smooth, continuous contour. The open space created by the curved shape is empty and does not have any internal elements or features.
