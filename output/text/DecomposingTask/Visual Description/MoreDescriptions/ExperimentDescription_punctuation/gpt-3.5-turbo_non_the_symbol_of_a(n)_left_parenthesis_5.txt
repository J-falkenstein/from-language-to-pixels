"""The symbol of a left parenthesis appears as a curved shape resembling a half circle, but with a larger opening on the right side. The bottom part of the curve is aligned horizontally, while the top part slopes upwards. The opening of the parenthesis is positioned on the right side, creating a space within the curved shape. The left side of the shape is closed, forming a solid boundary. The proportions of the left parenthesis are typically such that the width is larger than the height. The overall orientation of the left parenthesis is vertical, with the curve facing towards the left."""
