The left parenthesis symbol is an open curved shape that resembles a backwards letter "C" or a half circle. It starts on the left side, curves upwards and then loops back down to the right, forming an open space within the shape. The top and bottom of the shape are aligned horizontally, creating a symmetrical appearance. The shape is larger in height compared to its width, with the opening towards the right side. The interior of the shape is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the curved shape.
