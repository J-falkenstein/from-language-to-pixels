The symbol of a left parenthesis resembles a curved arc with an opening on the right side. The shape is similar to a letter 'C', but the ends of the curve do not meet. It starts at the top with a slight curve to the left, then smoothly transitions to a more pronounced curve downwards. The bottom portion of the curve is aligned horizontally with the top portion, forming an open space between the two. The left parenthesis does not have any other elements or features, and its primary characteristic is the curved shape that creates an open area on the right side.
