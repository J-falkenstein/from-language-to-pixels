"""The left parenthesis symbol is a curved shape that resembles a half circle with an open end facing to the right. It starts at the top with a rounded corner, curves downwards, and then continues horizontally to form the bottom of the half circle. The shape is open on the right side, leaving a clear space. The top and bottom edges of the half circle are aligned and parallel to each other. The curved portion is smooth and continuous, without any breaks or angles."""
