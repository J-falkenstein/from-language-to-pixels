The less than sign (<) is a symbol that is often used in mathematical equations or comparisons. It is shaped like a diagonal line that slopes from the top left to the bottom right. The line starts at the top left corner and gradually slopes downwards as it moves towards the bottom right corner. The line is straight and does not have any curves or bends. It is thinner in width compared to other symbols like the letter 'L' or 'T'. The top end of the line is shorter in length compared to the bottom end, creating an angled shape. The symbol can be visualized as an arrow pointing towards the right with its tip slightly slanted downwards. The less than sign is often used to indicate that one value is smaller or less than another value in mathematical or comparative contexts.
