"""The less than sign is a symbol that resembles a triangle pointing towards the left. It consists of a straight horizontal line at the bottom, which serves as the base of the triangle. Above this line, there is a diagonal line that starts on the right side of the base and slants towards the left, ending just before the top of the triangle. The diagonal line is shorter than the base, creating an open space on the left side of the triangle. The top of the triangle is curved, adding a gentle rounded touch to the overall shape of the symbol. The triangle is aligned vertically, with all its elements in a straight, upward orientation."""
