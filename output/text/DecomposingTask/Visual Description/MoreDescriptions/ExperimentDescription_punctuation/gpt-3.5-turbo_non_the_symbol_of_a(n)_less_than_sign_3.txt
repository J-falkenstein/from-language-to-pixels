"""The symbol of a less than sign is an angled line that slopes downward to the right. It starts at the top left of the symbol and ends at the bottom right. The line is straight and has a consistent width throughout. The symbol is open on the right side, forming an empty space between the end of the line and the edge of the symbol. The left side of the symbol is closed, with the line extending all the way to the left edge. The top of the line is aligned horizontally with the bottom of the symbol, while the bottom of the line extends slightly below the bottom edge of the symbol."""
