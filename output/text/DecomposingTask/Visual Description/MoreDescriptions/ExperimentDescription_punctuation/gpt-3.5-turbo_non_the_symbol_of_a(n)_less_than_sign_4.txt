"""The less than sign is a symbol that resembles an arrow pointing to the left. It has a distinct triangular shape with a flat base and a pointed tip. The straight edge of the triangle is aligned horizontally, while the other two sides slant inward towards the base. The shorter side of the triangle is on the left, and it is slightly longer than the diagonal side on the right. The arrowhead at the tip of the triangle is sharp and pointed. The symbol is typically drawn on a horizontal line, with the base of the triangle touching the line and the arrowhead extending above it."""
