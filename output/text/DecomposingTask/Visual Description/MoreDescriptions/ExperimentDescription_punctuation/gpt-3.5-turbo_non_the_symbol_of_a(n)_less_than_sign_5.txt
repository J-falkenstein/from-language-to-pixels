"The less than sign is a symbol that looks like an arrow pointing to the left. It consists of a straight horizontal line that is slightly shorter than the length of the arrow. The arrow starts at the left side of the line and curves gently to the right, ending with a pointed tip. The line and arrow are aligned vertically, with the arrowhead positioned above the line."
