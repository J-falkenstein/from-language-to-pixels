"""The less than sign (<) is a symbol that represents a smaller value when comparing two numbers or quantities. It is comprised of a single straight diagonal line that slants from the upper left downwards towards the lower right. The line is slightly longer than the horizontal line that would be formed by extending it. The diagonal line is positioned at an angle, creating an open space on the right side of the symbol."""
