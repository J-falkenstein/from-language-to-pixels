"The symbol of a percent sign is comprised of two elements. The first element is a small, circular dot positioned near the bottom of the symbol. It is slightly larger than a typical letter 'o'. Connected to the dot is a diagonal line that slants upwards and to the right at a forty-five-degree angle. The line starts from the bottom left of the dot and extends upwards and to the right, crossing the dot at its top right corner. The line is approximately twice the height of the dot. It forms an elongated curve, curving smoothly towards the right, resembling the shape of a lowercase letter 'L' intertwined with a letter 'C'."
