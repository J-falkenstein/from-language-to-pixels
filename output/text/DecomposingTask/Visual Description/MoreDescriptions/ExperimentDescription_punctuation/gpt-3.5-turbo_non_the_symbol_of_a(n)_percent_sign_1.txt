"""The symbol of a percent sign resembles a number 9 that has been rotated clockwise, with the bottom curve of the 9 becoming the top curve of the percent sign. The top curve of the percent sign is smaller and more rounded than the bottom curve. The curves are connected by a slightly diagonal line that starts at the top left of the top curve and ends at the bottom right of the bottom curve. The line is curved slightly outward in the middle, creating a gentle arc. Overall, the percent sign has a distinct elongated and curved shape, with the smaller top curve sitting atop the larger bottom curve."""
