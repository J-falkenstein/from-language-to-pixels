The symbol of a percent sign is composed of two elements. The bottom element is a small circle located at the center, while the top element is a vertical line that starts at the upper left side of the circle and curves to the right, forming a rounded shape. The line connects to the top of the circle, slightly overlapping it. The vertical line is longer than the diameter of the circle, extending above and below it. The circle sits directly below the curve of the vertical line, touching it at a single point. The circle is smaller in size compared to the vertical line. The overall shape of the percent sign is reminiscent of a number 9, but with the lower portion of the loop replaced by a circle. The vertical line and circle align vertically, creating a clear and distinct visual separation between the two elements.
