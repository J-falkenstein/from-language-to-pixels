"The symbol for a percent sign is a loop-like shape that resembles the number 9 turned on its side. It consists of a curved line that starts from the bottom left, curves upwards to the right, and then loops back in the opposite direction, forming a closed shape. The top section of the loop overlaps with the lower section. The overall shape is similar to a lowercase letter 'e' but with a larger loop. The proportions of the loop are typically smaller compared to the lowercase 'e'. The loop is aligned in a horizontal orientation, with the top section slightly higher than the bottom section. The spatial relationship between the top and bottom sections is such that they are connected at a single point, creating a smooth and continuous loop."
