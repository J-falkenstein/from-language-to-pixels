"The percent sign symbol is formed by a horizontal line at the bottom, followed by a looped curve that extends upward and to the right. The looped curve resembles a lowercase letter 'o' that has been elongated and tilted at an angle. The top part of the looped curve is wider and open, while the bottom part connects smoothly to the horizontal line. The symbol is aligned in a vertical orientation, with the looped curve extending above the horizontal line."
