"""The percent sign symbol is formed by a horizontal line placed above a curved vertical line. The horizontal line is slightly longer than the curved vertical line. The vertical line begins on the left side of the symbol, curves gently to the right, and extends below the horizontal line. The curve of the vertical line is smooth and continuous, resembling a lowercase letter 'L' that has been elongated and curved."""
