"""The percent sign is a symbol that is often used to represent a percentage or proportion. It consists of a small circle located at the bottom, which is connected to a diagonal line that extends upwards and to the right. The diagonal line starts at the bottom-left side of the circle and curves diagonally to the right, reaching a point slightly above the top-right side of the circle. The circle and diagonal line are aligned vertically, with the circle positioned slightly below the midpoint of the diagonal line. The circle is smaller in size compared to the overall height of the diagonal line. The diagonal line and circle together form a distinctive shape that is instantly recognizable as the symbol for a percentage."""
