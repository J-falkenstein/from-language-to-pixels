The percent sign symbol is comprised of two main elements. The first element is a circle, similar to the number 0, but slightly elongated vertically. The circle is positioned at the bottom and centered within the overall symbol. It is a complete curve with no openings or breaks.

The second element is a diagonal line that starts from the top left corner of the circle and slants downward towards the right side. The line is positioned diagonally, intersecting the circle at the upper left and upper right corners. It extends slightly beyond the right side of the circle, forming a small tail-like shape. The line is straight and does not curve or bend.

The size and proportions of the percent sign symbol may vary, but typically the circle is larger than the diagonal line. The circle takes up the majority of the symbol's height, while the diagonal line occupies a smaller portion at the top. The alignment between the circle and the line is centered and symmetric.

Overall, the percent sign symbol can be described as a vertically elongated circle with a diagonal line extending from the top left corner of the circle towards the right side, forming a distinctive and recognizable shape.
