The percent sign symbol (%) is a combination of a number 9 and a diagonal line. The shape of the symbol resembles a lowercase letter "o" followed by a diagonal line slanting upwards and to the right. The bottom part of the symbol is a closed circle similar to the number 0, but slightly smaller in size. The circle is aligned horizontally in the middle, with the diagonal line starting at the top right corner of the circle and extending diagonally upwards and to the right. The diagonal line is slightly shorter than the height of the circle and is positioned at an angle of about 45 degrees. The line intersects with the circle at the right side, slightly above the center. The circle and the diagonal line are connected smoothly, without any sharp corners or breaks. The overall shape of the percent sign is compact and recognizable, with the circle and diagonal line forming a distinct and cohesive unit.
