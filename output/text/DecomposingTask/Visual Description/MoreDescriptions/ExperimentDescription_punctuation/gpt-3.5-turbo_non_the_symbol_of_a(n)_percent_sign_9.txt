"The percent sign is represented by a circle with a vertical line extending from the top of the circle's left side. The circle is positioned towards the bottom of the vertical line. The circle is smaller in size compared to the circle in the number 6 description. The vertical line is straight and extends upwards from the left side of the circle, stopping at a certain length above the circle. The circle and the vertical line are aligned in a straight vertical orientation, with the circle positioned slightly below the midpoint of the vertical line. The interior of the circle is typically empty, forming a clear, open space within the circle."
