The symbol of a plus sign is a simple, straight vertical line intersected by a straight horizontal line. The vertical line is aligned centrally within the horizontal line, creating four equal quadrants. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, extending above and below it. The intersection of the two lines is precisely at the midpoint, forming a right angle. There are no other curved or angled elements present, resulting in a symmetrical and balanced shape.
