"The symbol of a plus sign is formed by two straight, intersecting lines of equal length. The vertical line runs vertically from top to bottom, while the horizontal line stretches horizontally from left to right. The two lines meet at a point in the center, forming a perfect cross. The lines are perpendicular to each other, creating four equal quadrants. The ends of both lines are straight, without any curves or angles."
