"""The plus sign symbol is a simple geometric shape consisting of two straight lines intersecting at a right angle. The vertical line is longer than the horizontal line, with the intersection point in the center. The vertical line extends from the top to the bottom of the image, while the horizontal line extends from the left to the right. The lines are aligned vertically and horizontally, with the horizontal line intersecting the vertical line in the middle. The overall shape of the plus sign is symmetric, with equal distances between the tips of each line and the intersection point. The lines are solid and have a consistent thickness throughout."""
