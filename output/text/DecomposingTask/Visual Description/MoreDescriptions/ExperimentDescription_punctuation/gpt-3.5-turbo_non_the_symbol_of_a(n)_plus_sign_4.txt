"The plus sign is a simple symbol made up of two straight lines. It consists of a vertical line that extends from the top to the bottom, and a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line at the center point. Both lines are of equal length and meet at a right angle. The vertical line is positioned in the middle of the horizontal line, creating four equal quadrants around the intersection point. The lines are aligned perfectly, forming a clear, symmetrical cross shape."
