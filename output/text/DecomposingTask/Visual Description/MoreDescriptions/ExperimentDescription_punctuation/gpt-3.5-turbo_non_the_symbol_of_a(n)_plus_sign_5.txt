"The plus sign is formed by two perpendicular lines of equal length that intersect at a central point. The vertical line runs from the top to the bottom, while the horizontal line extends from the left to the right. The point of intersection is right in the middle, creating four equal quadrants. Both lines are straight and have no curves or angles."
