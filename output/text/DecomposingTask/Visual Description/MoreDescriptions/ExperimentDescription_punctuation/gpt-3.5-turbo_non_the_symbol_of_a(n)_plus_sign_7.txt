"""The plus sign symbol consists of two straight lines that intersect each other at a 90-degree angle, forming four equal quadrants. The vertical line is positioned in the center, extending from the top to the bottom of the symbol. The horizontal line is positioned in the center as well, crossing the vertical line at the exact middle. The length of both lines is equal, creating a symmetrical appearance. All four endpoints where the lines intersect are aligned to form right angles."""
