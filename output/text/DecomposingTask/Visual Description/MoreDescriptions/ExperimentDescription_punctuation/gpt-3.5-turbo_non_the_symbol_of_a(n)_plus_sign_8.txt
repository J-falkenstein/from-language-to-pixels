"The symbol of a plus sign consists of two straight lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle, forming four equal quadrants. The vertical line is positioned directly above the horizontal line, with both lines extending to the same length. The intersection of the lines occurs at the exact center of the symbol, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance."
