"The symbol of a plus sign consists of two straight lines intersecting each other at a right angle. The vertical line extends from the top to the bottom, while the horizontal line stretches from the left to the right. The two lines are of equal length and form a perfect cross shape in the center. The intersection point is exactly in the middle of the lines, creating four equal quadrants around it. The lines are aligned in a perpendicular manner, with the vertical line positioned upright and the horizontal line positioned flat."
