"""The symbol of a right bracket resembles a vertical line that begins at the top, extends downward, and then curves sharply to the right. The top part of the line is longer than the bottom part, and the curve is positioned towards the right side. The vertical line is straight and perpendicular to the base, creating a distinct right angle. The overall shape is open on the left side and closed on the right side, resembling a backward-facing L."""
