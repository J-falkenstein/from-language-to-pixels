"""The symbol of a right bracket resembles a vertical line that is shorter in length than the height of a capital letter, with a small horizontal line extending to the right at the top end. The vertical line is straight and aligned in a perfectly vertical orientation. The horizontal line is positioned towards the top of the vertical line, creating a right angle between the two lines. The horizontal line is shorter in length than the vertical line, and it extends to the right in a straight manner."""
