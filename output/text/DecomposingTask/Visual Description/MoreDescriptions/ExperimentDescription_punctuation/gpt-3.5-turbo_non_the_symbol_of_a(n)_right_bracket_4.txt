"""The symbol of a right bracket is a vertical line that is longer than it is wide. It is positioned in a straight, upright orientation. The top end of the line is slightly curved to the right, resembling a small hook or a backward slanted apostrophe. The bottom end of the line is straight. The line is thicker and more bold in appearance, compared to other elements. It is typically used as a punctuation mark to indicate a closing or ending, and is often seen in pairs with a left bracket symbol."""
