"""The symbol of a right bracket resembles a vertical line that starts at the top and extends downwards. Towards the bottom, it curves to the right in a smooth and gradual manner, resembling a half-circle. The curving portion of the line starts on the left side, slightly below the top, and reaches its maximum curvature towards the middle. After the curve, the line continues downward in a straight vertical alignment. The bottom end of the line is aligned horizontally with the starting point of the curved portion, creating a visual closure. Overall, the symbol has a tall and slender shape with a distinct curved feature towards the bottom right."""
