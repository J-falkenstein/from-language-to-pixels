The symbol of a right bracket resembles a vertical line that is slightly curved towards the right. The line starts at the top and extends downwards, curving gently to the right. It has a distinct stop at the bottom, where it forms a small horizontal line that extends to the right. The vertical line and the horizontal line are aligned in a straight diagonal orientation. The length of the vertical line is typically longer than the horizontal line. The overall shape of the right bracket is similar to a backwards letter "L".
