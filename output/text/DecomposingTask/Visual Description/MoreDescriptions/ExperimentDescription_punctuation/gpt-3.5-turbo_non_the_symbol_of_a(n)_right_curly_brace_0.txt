The right curly brace symbol is comprised of a vertical line followed by a curved, elongated shape on the right side. The vertical line is straight and aligned vertically, extending upward from the bottom. At the top of the vertical line, it curves to the right in a smooth, rounded manner. The curved shape is elongated and has a similar appearance to a hook or a backward "C". It starts from the top right end of the vertical line and curves gracefully to the right, forming a smooth and continuous shape. The bottom end of the curved shape meets the vertical line again, creating a closed loop. The overall appearance is that of a gently curving shape connected to a straight vertical line.
