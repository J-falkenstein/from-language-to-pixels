The symbol of a right curly brace is a curved line that begins at the top left and slightly curves to the right before descending vertically. It resembles the shape of a lowercase letter 'L' with an extended tail at the bottom. The top portion of the curve is relatively straight before gracefully curving downwards. The bottom end of the line is positioned slightly to the right of the starting point, creating an open space within the curve. The overall shape of the right curly brace gives the impression of a hinged motion, with the top portion appearing to swing and rest on the vertical line.
