"""The right curly brace symbol is an open curved shape that starts with a slightly angled vertical line on the left side. It then curves smoothly to the right, forming a large open loop that follows a clockwise direction. The loop gradually becomes smaller as it progresses, until it ends with a short vertical line that is parallel to the initial line. The right side of the loop is aligned with the vertical line, creating a balanced and symmetrical shape."""
