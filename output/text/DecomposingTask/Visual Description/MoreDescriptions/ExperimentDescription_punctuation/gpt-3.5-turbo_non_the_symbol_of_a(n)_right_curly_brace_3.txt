The symbol of a right curly brace is a curved line that starts at the top left corner and curves downwards to the bottom left corner. The curve is rounded and smooth, resembling a backward letter "C." The top and bottom ends of the line are aligned horizontally and parallel to each other. The left side of the line is longer and extends slightly further downwards than the right side. Overall, the right curly brace has a distinct shape and is easily recognizable due to its curved form and specific alignment of its elements.
