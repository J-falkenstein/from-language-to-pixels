"The symbol of a right curly brace resembles a curved, open-ended shape that starts at the top and curves inward, resembling the letter 'S' or a curled-up snake. The shape begins with a horizontal line that curves downward, then forms a gradual, smooth curve to the right. The bottom end of the shape is open, leaving a gap between the end and the rest of the curve. The curve is slightly elongated, with the bottom end extending farther to the right than the top end."
