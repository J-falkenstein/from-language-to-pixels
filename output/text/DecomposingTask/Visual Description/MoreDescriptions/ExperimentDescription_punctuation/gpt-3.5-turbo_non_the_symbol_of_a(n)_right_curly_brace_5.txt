The symbol of a right curly brace is a curved, open shape that resembles a backwards letter 'S' with a short horizontal line at the top. It starts with a vertical line on the left side, which then curves smoothly to the right, forming an arc. The top end of the arc meets a short horizontal line that extends to the right, perpendicular to the arc. The overall shape of the right curly brace is fluid and graceful, with a distinct curve and a small, straight section at the top.
