The symbol of a right curly brace is an elongated, curved shape with a distinct curl at the end. It starts at the top left with a short vertical line that curves to the right, bending back on itself to create a horizontal segment. From the end of the horizontal segment, the line gently curves downward to form the main body of the brace. The body is curved in a smooth arc, gradually tapering and narrowing as it extends downward. The bottom end of the brace curls back on itself again, creating a small loop-like shape. Overall, the brace has a symmetrical and flowing appearance, with a clear distinction between the initial vertical line, the curving body, and the curled bottom. The vertical line and the body are aligned in a vertical orientation. The brace may be open on the right side, with a clear space between the end of the body and the horizontal segment, allowing it to encompass or enclose other elements.
