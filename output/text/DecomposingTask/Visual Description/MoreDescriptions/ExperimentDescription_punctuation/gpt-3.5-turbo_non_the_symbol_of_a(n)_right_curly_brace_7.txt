"The symbol of a right curly brace resembles a half-circle that starts at the top left corner with a small horizontal line segment, then curves smoothly downwards and to the right, forming an open curve. The bottom part of the curve aligns with the starting small horizontal line, creating a visually balanced and complete shape. The curve is positioned vertically, with the top part facing left and the bottom part facing right. The right curly brace is commonly used to enclose or group related elements."
