"The symbol of a right curly brace is a curved shape resembling a backwards letter 'C'. It starts with a short horizontal line at the top, curving downwards to the right in a smooth, continuous curve. The curve extends further down and then slightly curves back up to form a vertical line that aligns with the starting horizontal line. The overall shape has a distinct, open and curved appearance, similar to a curved bracket or parenthesis."
