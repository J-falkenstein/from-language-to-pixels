"""The symbol of a right curly brace resembles a curved, U-shaped figure that opens to the right. The top of the brace starts with a short vertical line that curves smoothly to the right, forming a rounded shape. The curve continues downward, gradually straightening out towards the bottom. The bottom of the brace ends with a short horizontal line that is parallel to the top line. The overall shape of the brace is symmetrical and fluid, with no sharp angles or corners."""
