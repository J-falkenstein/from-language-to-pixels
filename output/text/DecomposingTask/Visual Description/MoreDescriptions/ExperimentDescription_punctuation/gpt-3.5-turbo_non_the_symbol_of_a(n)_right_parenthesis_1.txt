The right parenthesis symbol consists of a curved line that starts at the upper left side and arcs down and to the right, ending at a point that is lower than its starting position. The line is smoothly curved, resembling a half circle that is open on one side. The curved line is thicker on one end, gradually thinning towards the other end. It is positioned vertically and typically used to enclose or indicate the end of a group or section of text.
