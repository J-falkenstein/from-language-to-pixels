"The right parenthesis symbol is a curved shape that resembles the open end of a bracket '[' or a lowercase letter 'c'. The opening of the curve starts from the left and moves to the right, curving downward and then curving slightly back up. The curve is open on the left side and closed on the right side, forming a rounded shape. It is typically smaller in size compared to other brackets or parentheses. The right parenthesis is often used to enclose or separate elements in a list or to indicate a group or subcategory within a larger context."
