"The symbol of a right parenthesis is a curved shape that resembles a half circle. It starts with a curved vertical line on the left side, which then curves to the right to form the top part of the parenthesis. The curved line then continues downward, gradually curving less until it reaches a straight horizontal line at the bottom. The entire shape is open on the left side and closed on the right side."
