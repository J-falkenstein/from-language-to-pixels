"The symbol of a right parenthesis resembles a curved, semi-circular shape that is open on the right side. The shape starts with a vertical line that is slightly curved to the left, then smoothly transitions into a half-circle shape that is open on the right side. The top and bottom of the half-circle shape align horizontally with each other, creating a symmetrical appearance. The curved part of the shape is smaller than a full circle, and it is positioned to the right of the vertical line, creating an open space on the right side. The overall shape has a rounded appearance, with smooth curves and no sharp angles."
