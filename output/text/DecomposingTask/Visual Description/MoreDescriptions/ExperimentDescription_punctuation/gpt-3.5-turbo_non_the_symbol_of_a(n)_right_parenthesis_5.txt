"""The symbol of a right parenthesis resembles a curved line that is open on the left side and closes on the right. The curved line starts at the top left and gradually curves downwards and towards the right, ending in a smooth and rounded arc. The shape is similar to a half-circle, but with an open left side. The right end of the parenthesis is aligned vertically with the left end, creating a symmetrical and balanced appearance. The space enclosed by the curved line is typically empty, forming a clear and defined shape."""
