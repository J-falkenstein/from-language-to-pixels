"""The symbol of a right parenthesis is a curved shape that resembles a half circle. Its top end starts on the left side and curves to the right, creating a smooth and rounded shape. The bottom end of the curve is aligned with the top end, completing the shape. The right parenthesis is typically smaller in size compared to other characters or symbols, and it is often used to indicate grouping or enclosure within a text or equation."""
