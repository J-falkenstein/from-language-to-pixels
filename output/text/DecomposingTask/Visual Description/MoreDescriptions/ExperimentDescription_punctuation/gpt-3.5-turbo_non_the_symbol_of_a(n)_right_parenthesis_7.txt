"The symbol of a right parenthesis is a small, curved shape that resembles a half circle or a rounded bracket. It starts at the top left with a slightly curved horizontal line that gradually curves downwards and ends at the bottom right. The shape is open on the left side, while the right side is closed, forming a complete curved outline. The bottom part of the shape aligns horizontally with the top part, creating a symmetrical and balanced appearance. The right parenthesis is typically smaller in size compared to other symbols or characters."
