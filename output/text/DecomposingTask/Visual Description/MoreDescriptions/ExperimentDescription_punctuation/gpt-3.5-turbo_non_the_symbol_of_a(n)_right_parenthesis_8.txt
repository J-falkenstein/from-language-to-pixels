"The symbol of a right parenthesis resembles a curved shape that looks like a letter 'C' turned sideways and facing right. It starts with a small curved line that extends upwards from the left side, then curves sharply towards the right, forming a rounded shape. The topmost point of the curve is aligned with the starting point of the small curved line. The inner space of the parenthesis is typically empty, forming a clear, open area within the curved shape."
