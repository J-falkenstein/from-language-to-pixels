"""The right parenthesis symbol is a curved element resembling a half circle that opens to the right. It starts with a vertical straight line at the top and then curves smoothly to the right, forming a semicircular shape. The bottom of the curve connects to a short, straight horizontal line that extends to the right. The overall shape is similar to a closed bracket without the vertical line on the left side."""
