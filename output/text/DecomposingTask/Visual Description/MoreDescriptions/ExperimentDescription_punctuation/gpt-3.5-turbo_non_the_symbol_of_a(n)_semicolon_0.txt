The symbol of a semicolon looks like a combination of a comma and a period. It is made up of two distinct parts. The top part is a curved arc, similar to a comma, that starts from the left and curves upward to the right. The arc is not a complete circle, but more like a backwards "C" shape. The bottom part is a straight vertical line that extends downward from the center of the arc like a period. The line is aligned in the middle of the arc and extends below it. The arc and line are connected seamlessly, with no gaps or overlaps. The overall shape of the semicolon is like a small, rounded "L" with a curved top. The arc and line are proportionate in size, with the arc being slightly larger than the line. The spatial relationship between the two elements is such that the line extends vertically from the center of the arc, creating a symmetrical and balanced composition.
