"""The symbol of a semicolon consists of two elements. The first element is a dot positioned directly above a small comma-like curve. The dot is located slightly above the midpoint of the curve. The curve starts on the left side, slanting upwards and to the right, and then curves downwards and to the right, ending just below the dot. The dot and curve are aligned in a vertical orientation, with the curve slightly longer than the dot. The dot is small and circular, while the curve is smooth and resembles the shape of a small letter 'C' or a backwards 'C'."""
