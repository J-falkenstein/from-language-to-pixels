"""The symbol of a semicolon is comprised of two distinct elements. The top element is a dot or a small circle, positioned at the upper center. Below the dot, there is a curved, vertical line that extends downward about two-thirds the height of the dot. The line starts slightly to the right of the dot and curves slightly to the right as it descends. The dot and the curved line are not directly connected but are positioned close to each other, with a small gap in between. The dot is smaller in size compared to the line and is aligned in a straight vertical orientation, while the line is aligned at a slight angle, sloping towards the right as it descends."""
