The semicolon symbol (;) is shaped like a comma (,) placed on top of a period (.) with no space in between. The top portion of the semicolon is a curved, downward-facing comma, similar to a lowercase "c", but with a flatter top. The bottom portion is a small dot, like a period, located directly underneath the curved part and touching it. The two parts are aligned vertically, with the comma-shaped curve positioned above the dot. The comma portion is slightly larger than the dot, creating a noticeable size contrast between the two elements. Overall, the semicolon has a clean and distinct shape, with the comma and dot forming a continuous vertical line.
