"The symbol of a semicolon is formed by two distinct parts. The top part is a dot positioned slightly above the center of the symbol. Directly below the dot is a curved line that starts from the left side and gently curves upwards towards the right. The curve is smooth and symmetrical, resembling the shape of a small, lowercase letter 'c'. The bottom part of the symbol is a straight line that extends horizontally from the right end of the curved line, aligning with the dot above. The line is parallel to the ground and is slightly shorter in length compared to the curved line above it. Together, these two elements create a visually balanced and distinct symbol."
