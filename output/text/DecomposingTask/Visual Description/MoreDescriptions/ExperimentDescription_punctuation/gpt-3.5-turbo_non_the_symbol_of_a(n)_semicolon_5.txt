The symbol of a semicolon is comprised of two distinct elements. It consists of a vertically aligned dot placed above a comma-shaped curve. The dot is positioned slightly higher than the top of the curve. The curve starts on the left side, curving downwards and then looping back towards the right, forming a smooth arc. The dot and the curve are aligned vertically, with the curve extending downwards from the dot. The dot and the curve do not intersect or touch each other. The dot is smaller in size compared to the curve. The overall shape of the semicolon is reminiscent of a small, elongated raindrop suspended in mid-air.
