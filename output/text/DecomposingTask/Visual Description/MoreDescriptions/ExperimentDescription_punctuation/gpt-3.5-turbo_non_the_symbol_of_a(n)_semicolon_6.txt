"""The semicolon symbol is made up of two distinct elements. The top element is a small dot positioned slightly above the center of a horizontal line. The dot is smaller in size compared to the line and is aligned directly above it. The bottom element is a curved, upward-facing arc that starts from the right end of the horizontal line and curves to the left, forming a symmetrical shape resembling a lowercase 'c'. The arc is positioned below the horizontal line and is slightly longer than the line. The dot and the curved arc are aligned vertically with each other at their center points."""
