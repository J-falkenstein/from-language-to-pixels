The symbol of a semicolon resembles a comma positioned above a period. It consists of a small, curved dot placed at the bottom, followed by a slightly larger, curved dot positioned above it. The bottom dot is located closer to the ground, while the top dot is elevated. The two dots are aligned vertically, with the top dot directly above the bottom dot. The semicolon has a graceful and flowing appearance, with both dots possessing a rounded shape. The dot at the top is larger and more pronounced than the dot at the bottom.
