"The symbol of a semicolon is formed by a dot placed above a comma. The dot is positioned at the top center and resembles a small, round shape. Just below the dot, the comma begins, curving downwards and then curving back upwards in a smooth, flowing motion. The comma is slightly longer than the dot and is aligned vertically with it, creating a stacked effect. The overall shape of the semicolon is elongated and slender, with a distinct punctuation-like appearance."
