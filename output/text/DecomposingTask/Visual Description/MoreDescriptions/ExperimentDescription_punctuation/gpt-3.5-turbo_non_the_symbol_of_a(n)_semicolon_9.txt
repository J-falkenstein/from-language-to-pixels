"""The semicolon symbol is composed of a small dot placed slightly above and to the right of a larger comma-like shape. The comma-like shape begins at the top left and curves downwards to the right, forming a rounded bottom before curving upwards to the right again, ending with a slight tail. The dot rests just above the top curve of the comma-like shape, creating a noticeable spacing between the dot and the rest of the symbol. The dot and the comma-like shape are aligned vertically, with the dot appearing slightly off-center towards the right side of the shape."""
