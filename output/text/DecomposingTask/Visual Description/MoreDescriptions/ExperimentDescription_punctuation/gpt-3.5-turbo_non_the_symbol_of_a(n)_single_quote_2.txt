"""The single quote symbol is a small vertical line that is positioned slightly above the baseline. It is oriented in a straight vertical direction, with no curves or angles. The height of the line is typically shorter than the height of lowercase letters and is often used in conjunction with other characters or as a punctuation mark to indicate a quotation, contraction, or possessive."""
