"The symbol of a single quote resembles a tiny, vertical line that is straight and narrow. It is positioned at the top-left corner and is oriented in a perpendicular direction to the neighboring elements. Its length is relatively short, typically a fraction of the height of the surrounding characters or objects. It serves as a punctuation mark or a marker of quotation, denoting the beginning or end of a quoted passage."
