The symbol of a single quote is a small mark that resembles an elevated comma. It is a vertical line that is slightly shorter than the height of a typical letter. The single quote is often used to indicate the omission of letters or to indicate the start or end of a quotation. It is positioned at the top right of the line of text, aligned with the baseline of the surrounding letters.
