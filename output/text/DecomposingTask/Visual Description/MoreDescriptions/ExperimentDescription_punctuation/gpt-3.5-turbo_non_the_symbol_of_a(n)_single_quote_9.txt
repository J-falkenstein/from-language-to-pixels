"""The symbol of a single quote appears as a small, vertical line that is aligned with the baseline or the bottom of a line of text. It is similar to an apostrophe, but it stands alone and is not connected to any other characters. The single quote is typically a short, straight line that extends vertically upwards from the baseline, with no distinctive features or additional elements."""
