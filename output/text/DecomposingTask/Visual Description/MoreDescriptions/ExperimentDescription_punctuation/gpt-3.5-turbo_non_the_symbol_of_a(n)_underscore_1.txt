"""The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line that extends from left to right, typically positioned at the bottom of the line of text. It is a thin, elongated shape that has no curves or angles, resembling a very low, flat dash. The length of the underscore can vary depending on the width of the text it is under, but it is usually shorter than the width of the letter 'm' or 'n' in the same font and size. The underscore is aligned with the baseline of the text, creating a clear separation between the text and any other elements above or below it."""
