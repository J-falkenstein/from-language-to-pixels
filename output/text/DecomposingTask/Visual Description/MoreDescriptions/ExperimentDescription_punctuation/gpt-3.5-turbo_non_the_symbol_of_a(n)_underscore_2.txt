"The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line that is typically shorter in length compared to other symbols. It is positioned below other elements, such as letters or numbers, and acts as a visual divider or connector between them. The underscore is aligned horizontally with the baseline of the text, appearing as a thin and continuous line that runs from left to right, without any curves or angles."
