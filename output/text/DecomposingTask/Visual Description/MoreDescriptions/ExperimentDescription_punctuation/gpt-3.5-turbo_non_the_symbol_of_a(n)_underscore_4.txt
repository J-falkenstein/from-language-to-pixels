The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line positioned at the bottom of the writing space. It extends from the left edge to the right edge, with no curves or angles. The length of the underscore can vary, but it typically spans the width of the writing space. Its purpose is to indicate a space or separation between words or elements.
