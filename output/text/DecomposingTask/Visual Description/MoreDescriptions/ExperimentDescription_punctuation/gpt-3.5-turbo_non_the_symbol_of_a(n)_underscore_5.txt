"""The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line that stretches across the page. It is typically thin and evenly spaced, with no breaks or interruptions. The underscore is aligned with the baseline of the text, appearing just below the bottom edge of letters or words. It provides a solid line that separates or emphasizes content, with no height or thickness, creating a visual distinction without overpowering the surrounding elements."""
