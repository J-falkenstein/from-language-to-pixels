The symbol of an underscore resembles a straight horizontal line that extends across the page. Its length is typically longer than its height. It is positioned at the bottom of the writing area, parallel to the baseline of the text. The underscore serves as a visual separator or connector, often used to emphasize or link words or phrases.
