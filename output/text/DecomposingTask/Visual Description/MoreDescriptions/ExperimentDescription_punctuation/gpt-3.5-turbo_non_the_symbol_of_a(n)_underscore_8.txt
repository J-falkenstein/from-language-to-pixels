"The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line that stretches across the page. It is typically thin and extends from the left side to the right side, with no curves or breaks in its shape. The underscore is positioned at the bottom of the line of text or above another element, such as a hyphen or a word. It serves as a visual separator or connector between different elements and is often used in writing or typing for emphasis or clarity."
