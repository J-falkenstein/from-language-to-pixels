The symbol of an underscore is a straight horizontal line that is typically longer than it is tall. It is positioned at the bottom of a line of text and extends across the entire width of the line. The underscore is typically thin and consistently straight, and it is used to separate words or emphasize a specific section of text. It does not have any distinct features or proportions beyond its straight, horizontal orientation.
