A chess board is a square-shaped object with a checkered pattern on its surface. It consists of 64 small squares in total, arranged in an 8x8 grid. The squares alternate between two colors, typically black and white. Each square is of the same size and has equal width and height.

The chess board has a clear distinction between vertical and horizontal lines, forming the grid. The vertical lines run from top to bottom and are parallel, while the horizontal lines are parallel to each other and extend from left to right. The corners of the chess board are right angles.

The distinctive feature of a chess board is its checkered pattern. This pattern is created by the alternating colors of the squares. The black squares are typically dark and the white squares are light in color. The squares next to each other, both horizontally and vertically, have opposite colors.

The proportions of the chess board remain constant, with each square being equal in size. The alignment of the squares creates a sense of order on the board, providing a clear visual representation of how the pieces are positioned during a game.

To summarize, a chess board is a square object with a checkered pattern of 64 equal-sized squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The alternating colors of the squares, dark and light, create a distinct visual appearance. The vertical and horizontal lines form the grid, with right angles at the corners.
