A chess board consists of a square-shaped flat surface with a checkered pattern. The board is divided into 64 squares, alternating between light and dark colors. Typically, the board has eight rows and eight columns, forming a grid-like structure. 

Each square is of equal size and has clear edges. The light-colored squares are usually white or beige, while the dark-colored squares are black or brown. The squares are arranged in such a way that they form a pattern of vertical and horizontal lines.

The board's distinctive feature is the checkered pattern, which helps differentiate one square from another. It is this pattern that creates the playing surface for chess pieces. The squares are positioned in a way that every dark square is surrounded by light squares, and vice versa.

The proportions of the board are equal, with each square being the same size. The alignment of the squares forms a symmetrical grid, with rows and columns intersecting at right angles. Each square is adjacent to four other squares, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The spatial relationship of the board can be visualized as a flat, two-dimensional surface. It can be placed on a table or any other flat surface, with the squares facing upward. The board's orientation can vary, but traditionally, the bottom-left square is dark-colored.

Overall, a chess board is a square-shaped, checkered surface with a distinct pattern of light and dark squares. Its fundamental features include the square shape, checkered pattern, equal proportions, symmetrical alignment, and spatial relationship of the squares.
