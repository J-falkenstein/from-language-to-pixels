A boat is a watercraft that is designed to float and move across bodies of water. Its fundamental shape is typically long and narrow, resembling a long oval or a slim, elongated rectangle. 

Starting from the front, or the bow, a boat usually has a pointed or rounded shape that tapers towards the waterline. Moving towards the middle, it widens slightly to form the main body or hull of the boat. The hull can have a gentle curve or a flat bottom, depending on the type of boat. 

The boat's distinctive features include a raised area towards the front called the deck, which provides a platform for people to stand or sit on. Towards the rear, there is often a flat or slightly raised area called the stern, which serves as the back of the boat. The stern may have an outboard motor or an oarlock for manual propulsion. 

Another important aspect of a boat is the presence of oars or paddles, which are used to propel the boat through the water. These oars or paddles can be attached to the sides of the boat or located inside the boat, depending on the design. 

To give an idea of proportions, the length of a boat can vary greatly, but it is usually several times longer than its width. The height of the boat, when viewed from the side, is generally low and close to the waterline. 

When describing the spatial relationships, it's important to mention that the bow is located at the front, the stern is at the back, and the deck is on top. The oars or paddles are typically positioned towards the sides of the boat, near the center, and can be extended or retracted as needed. 

Overall, a boat can be recognized by its long and narrow shape, deck area, pointed or rounded bow, and the presence of oars or paddles for propulsion.
