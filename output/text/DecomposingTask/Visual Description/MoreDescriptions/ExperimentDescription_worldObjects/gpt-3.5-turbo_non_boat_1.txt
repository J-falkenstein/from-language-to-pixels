The boat has a long, narrow shape, like a stretched-out oval or capsule. Its body is primarily flat and horizontal, with a slight upward curve towards the front and back. At the front, there is a pointed structure called the bow, while the back end is rounded and called the stern. 

One of the most distinctive features of the boat is its raised sides, which are called gunwales. These gunwales run along the entire length of the boat, curving slightly upward. They help contain and protect the interior space of the boat. 

Inside the boat, there are seating areas and a main area called the cockpit. Towards the center or back, there may be a vertical structure called a mast, used for raising sails in sailboats. Additionally, there may be oars or an engine at the stern for propulsion.

The boat is typically balanced and floats on water, so it may have a slightly higher front compared to the back. It is important to note that the boat does not have wheels but instead moves through the water.

In summary, the boat's most important features are its long, narrow shape with a pointed bow and rounded stern, raised gunwales along the sides, and a possible mast or oars for propulsion.
