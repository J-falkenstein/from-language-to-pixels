A boat is a long and narrow water vessel. Imagine a rectangular shape standing upright on the water, taller than it is wide. At the center of the boat, there is a wide, flat area called the deck. Towards the front, you will find a pointed structure called the bow, which is slightly taller than the rest of the boat. It helps the boat glide through the water smoothly.

On either side of the boat, there are large, curved structures called hulls. These hulls curve upwards and connect to the deck, creating a smooth and rounded shape. The hulls are responsible for keeping the boat afloat by displacing water. Towards the back of the boat, you'll see a slightly smaller structure called the stern, which is opposite to the bow.

If you move your hand from the bow to the stern, you'll encounter a long, narrow, and vertical structure sticking out of the deck. This is the mast. It stands tall and supports the sail, helping the boat to catch the wind and move forward. There might also be ropes and pulleys called rigging attached to the mast.

Finally, on the deck, towards the stern, there might be an engine or oars that help propel the boat through the water. These features differ depending on the type of boat. Proportions can vary greatly, but the boat's overall length is typically longer than its width, giving it a slender appearance.

By following these descriptions, a simplified sketch of a boat can be attempted, focusing on the main components: a rectangular body with a pointed bow, curved hulls, a tall mast towards the center, and potentially an engine or oars towards the rear.
