A boat is a long and narrow watercraft that is primarily designed to float and move on water. Its fundamental shape is elongated, resembling a somewhat curved rectangle, with a pointy front and a wider rear. The boat is typically lower in height, providing a streamlined appearance.

Starting from the front, the boat has a pointed, triangular-shaped portion called the bow, which helps it cut through the water. Moving towards the rear, there is a flat or slightly raised platform called the deck, where people can stand or sit. The deck often features a raised area, known as the cabin, which provides shelter or accommodation on larger boats.

On the sides of the boat, you will find the walls called the hull. The hull is smooth and gently slopes inward, meeting at the bottom to form a V-shaped keel. This keel aids in providing stability and helps the boat maintain a straight course in the water. The hull and keel usually have a shiny finish, resembling a wet appearance due to water resistance.

Above the deck, there may be tall vertical poles, called masts, which support sails on some types of boats. These sails capture the wind, allowing the boat to move forward without using an engine. However, not all boats have masts and sails; many are powered by engines located at the rear.

At the rear, the boat features a wider area known as the stern, which may have a flat or slightly raised surface. This is where the engine is usually located. Additionally, there is a vertical structure called the rudder that extends below the waterline near the stern. The rudder helps control the boat's direction by turning it left or right.

To summarize, imagine a long, narrow watercraft with a pointed front (bow), a flat or slightly raised platform (deck), and smooth, inward-sloping walls (hull) that converge at the bottom into a V-shaped keel. On larger boats, there may be a raised cabin on the deck, and some boats have masts and sails or an engine at the rear (stern), which also includes a rudder below the waterline.
