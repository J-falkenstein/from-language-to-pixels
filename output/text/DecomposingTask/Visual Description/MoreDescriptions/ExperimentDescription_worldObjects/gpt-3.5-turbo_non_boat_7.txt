A boat is a long, slender object that is typically wider in the middle and narrows towards the ends. Its shape can be described as resembling a stretched-out oval or a banana. The most distinctive feature of a boat is its hull, which is the bottom part that rests in the water. It has a curved, almost semi-circular shape that tapers towards the front and back.

The boat has a pronounced curving bow (front) that gently slopes upwards, while the stern (back) tends to be more flat or slightly angled. The bow can be compared to a pointed triangle, and the stern can be likened to a squared-off or angular shape.

In the middle of the boat, there may be a raised area called the cabin, which is usually boxy or rectangular in shape. The cabin provides shelter and living space for those on board. Towards the top, you may find a taller structure called the mast, which is often vertical and cylindrical. It is used to hoist sails or other rigging for propulsion.

Additionally, there may be some horizontal lines or ridges on the hull that separate different levels or sections of the boat. These lines help provide stability and organization to the structure.

The boat is situated in the water, so it has a visual relationship with its surroundings. The hull usually aligns parallel to the waterline, while the bow points forward and the stern faces backward.

When drawing a simplified sketch of a boat, focus on the elongated oval shape with a curved and narrowing hull. Include the pointed triangular bow, the squared-off or angular stern, the potential boxy cabin, and the vertical mast if visible.
