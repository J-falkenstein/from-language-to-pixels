A cactus is a unique plant with a distinct shape and features. It usually has a tall, vertical stem that stands upright like a pillar. The stem is cylindrical in shape and covered in thick, pointy spines that extend outwards. These spines are the most distinctive feature of a cactus, often arranged in patterns along the stem.

The cactus stem can vary in size and thickness depending on the species, but it generally remains consistent in its vertical alignment. Some cacti have multiple stems branching out from the base, while others have a single stem that extends upward.

At the top of the stem, you will often find clustered, vibrant flowers blooming. These flowers can be of various colors, such as red, pink, yellow, or white, and they add a beautiful contrast to the spiky stem.

When visualizing a cactus, it is essential to understand the spatial relationship between its elements. The spines usually cover the entire surface of the stem, pointing outwards in all directions. The flowers, on the other hand, typically appear in clusters near the top of the stem, creating a visually striking contrast against the green stem.

Overall, a cactus can be described as a tall, cylindrical plant covered in pointy spines, with vibrant flowers clustered at the top. The proportions can vary between species, but the vertical alignment and the distinctive spines are the key features to recognize a cactus.
