A cactus is a tall, spiky plant that usually stands upright. Its basic shape can be described as cylindrical or columnar, resembling a vertical cylinder or a tall column. The distinctive feature of a cactus is its numerous spines, which are like needles or spikes that cover the outer surface of the plant. These spines can be of varying lengths and thicknesses, and they often protrude outwards from the main body of the cactus. They are usually evenly distributed around the plant, giving it a rough and textured appearance.

To help with proportions and alignment, imagine the cactus as having a straight and vertical trunk or stem that forms the central axis of the plant. From there, the spines emerge in all directions, creating a radial pattern. The spines can be short or long, pointing upwards, downwards, or sideways. Some cacti may also have branches that grow out horizontally from the main stem, adding more complexity to their overall shape.

The spatial relationship between the spines and the main body of the cactus is essential in understanding its appearance. The spines themselves do not cover the entire surface but rather form clusters or groups, leaving some areas of the plant exposed. The spacing between the spines can vary, creating an irregular pattern throughout.

In summary, a cactus can be described as a tall, columnar plant covered in spines that form a radial pattern around its central trunk. The spines vary in length, direction, and thickness, adding to its distinctive and textured appearance. Remember, these descriptions are aimed at helping a blind person create a simplified sketch, so it's important to focus on the basic shape and the most prominent features of the cactus.
