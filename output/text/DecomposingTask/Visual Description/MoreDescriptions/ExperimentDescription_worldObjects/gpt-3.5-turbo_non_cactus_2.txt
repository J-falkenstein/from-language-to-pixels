A cactus is a unique plant with a distinct shape that sets it apart from other plants. Imagine a columnar or cylindrical shape, standing tall and upright. It has a predominantly vertical orientation, with some variations depending on the specific type of cactus. The main body or stem of the cactus can be described as elongated and sturdy.

Starting from the bottom, picture a broad base that gradually narrows and extends upward. As you move your hand up the stem, you may notice small bumps or protrusions, which are called spines or thorns. These spines are evenly spaced around the stem and can vary in length and thickness. They often curve slightly outward, providing a protective barrier for the cactus.

Towards the top of the cactus, the stem might taper off, becoming narrower and sometimes even branching out into arms or branches, depending on the species. These arms can extend horizontally outward, adding to the overall shape and giving the cactus a more complex silhouette.

Overall, the cactus has a spiky and textured appearance, with its stem being the dominant feature. Its shape is characterized by verticality, with the possibility of branching arms at the top. The spines or thorns covering the surface offer both a visual and tactile understanding of the cactus.
