A cactus is a plant that has a unique and recognizable shape. Imagine a vertical, cylindrical column with a slightly tapered appearance. The overall shape of a cactus can be likened to a tall, slender cylinder. 

Starting from the bottom, the cactus has a sturdy and thick base, which gradually narrows as it ascends. It may have several vertical ridges running along its length, giving it a ribbed appearance. The ribs are evenly spaced and extend from the base to the top.

At the top of the cactus, there is a distinctive crown of several branches, called arms or paddles. These arms can be either short or elongated, and they vary in number and arrangement depending on the cactus species. Some cacti have numerous arms, while others have only a few. The arms extend horizontally from the upper part of the cactus, adding width to its overall shape.

The surface of the cactus is covered with spines, which are long, thin, and pointed. The spines emerge from small bumps or areoles that scatter across the entire surface of the cactus. These spines can vary in length, color, and density, but they are essential for the identification of a cactus.

Overall, the cactus has a compact and upright stature, with the base wider than the upper portion where the arms emerge. The height of a cactus can vary greatly depending on the specific species, ranging from a few inches to several feet. However, its distinct cylindrical shape, ribbed texture, and branching arms with spines make it unmistakable even without the need for intricate details.
