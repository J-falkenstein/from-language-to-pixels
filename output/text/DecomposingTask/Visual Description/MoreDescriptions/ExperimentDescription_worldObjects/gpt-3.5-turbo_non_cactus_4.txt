A cactus is a unique and recognizable plant with a distinct shape. It typically has a tall, cylindrical body that stands upright. The body of a cactus usually consists of multiple segments, which look like elongated ovals stacked on top of each other. Each segment can vary in size and shape, but they are mostly uniform and have rounded edges.

One distinguishing feature of a cactus is its sharp spines. These spines grow out of the segments and act as a form of protection for the plant. They are long and pointy, protruding from the sides of each segment. The spines can be varying in length and thickness depending on the particular type of cactus.

The proportions of a cactus are important to note for a simplified sketch. The segments are generally wider at the bottom and gradually become narrower towards the top. The spines are evenly distributed along the sides of the segments, and they tend to point slightly upwards.

When drawing a cactus, it is also important to consider its alignment with other elements. Since cacti usually grow individually or in small clusters, they often have a clear separation from other plants or objects around them. You can emphasize this by leaving some space between the cactus and any nearby elements in the sketch.

Overall, a cactus can be simplified in a sketch to represent its essential features: the tall and cylindrical body with stacked segments and the presence of sharp spines.
