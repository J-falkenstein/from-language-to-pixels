A cactus is a plant that has a distinct shape and presence. It can be described as tall and cylindrical, often standing upright. The main body of the cactus is like a column, formed by interconnected segments or stems called "ribs." These ribs run vertically from the base to the top of the cactus.

At the top of the cactus, you will find various clusters or groups of spines. These spines are long, thin, and needle-like, protruding outward from the ribs. They are evenly spaced and cover the entire surface of the cactus, pointing upwards and outwards.

The base of the cactus is typically wider and can be described as rounded or bulbous, providing stability to the plant. It is important to note that some cacti have branches that grow out from the main stem, giving them a more bushy or tree-like appearance, but for a simplified sketch, focusing on the main stem is sufficient.

When drawing a cactus, it is useful to remember that the spines are the most distinct and recognizable feature. They give the cactus its unique appearance. Therefore, emphasizing their presence and arrangement on the cylindrical stem will help capture the essence of a cactus's visual characteristics.
