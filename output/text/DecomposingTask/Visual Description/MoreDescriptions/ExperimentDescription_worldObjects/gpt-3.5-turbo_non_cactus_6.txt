A cactus is a plant that has a very distinct and unique shape. It generally has a tall, upright and cylindrical body with a thick, sturdy stem known as a trunk. The trunk is often covered with sharp spines or needles that serve as protection. 

At the top of the trunk, you will find a cluster of branches that extend outward in irregular patterns. These branches are usually thick and fleshy, and they can be either segmented or have a more continuous form. Picture them as rounded or flattened structures.

Cacti come in various sizes, some growing as small as a few inches, while others can reach towering heights of several feet. The proportions of a cactus typically consist of the trunk being taller than the branches, giving it a vertical orientation.

When describing the spatial relationships, the branches of a cactus tend to radiate outwards from the trunk, creating a radial arrangement. Some cacti have branches that grow upwards, resembling arms reaching towards the sky, while others spread out in different directions.

Overall, the key elements to focus on when describing a cactus are its tall and cylindrical form, the presence of spines or needles covering the trunk, and the cluster of branches that extend outwards in various patterns.
