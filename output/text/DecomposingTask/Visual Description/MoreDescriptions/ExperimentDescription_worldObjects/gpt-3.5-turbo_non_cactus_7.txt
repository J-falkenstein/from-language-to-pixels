A cactus is a plant that typically grows in arid or desert regions. Its fundamental shape can be described as cylindrical or columnar, with a tall, upright stem. This stem often has multiple branches or arms extending out from it. The distinctive feature of a cactus is its thick, fleshy stem covered in sharp spines or thorns. These spines are usually long and pointed, often radiating in different directions from the stem. The spines can vary in color, ranging from light brown to dark brown or even black.

In terms of proportions, a cactus's stem and branches can vary in length and thickness depending on the species. Some cacti have short, stubby stems while others may have tall and slender ones. The branches can be evenly spaced or clustered together at the top of the stem. The alignment of the branches can either be straight and parallel to the stem or curve gently outward.

When describing the spatial relationships, it can be mentioned that the spines are evenly distributed across the surface of the stem, forming a dense and protective covering. The spines are positioned at different angles, providing a textured appearance to the cactus. The overall shape of a cactus can be likened to a vertical column with arms or branches extending outwards, creating a somewhat symmetrical and balanced form.

Remember to use vivid and expressive language while describing the cactus, so that the blind person can understand the object's essential features and sketch a simplified representation.
