A cactus is a unique plant known for its distinct shape and features. Imagine a slender, vertical object resembling a column or a tall cylinder. It stands upright and reaches varying heights, like a small tree. The cactus's shape is characterized by a central, elongated stem that tapers towards the top.

This plant has no conventional leaves; instead, it is covered in numerous spiky structures called thorns. These thorns are its most distinctive feature. They protrude from the stem in all directions and can vary in size and density, creating a textured surface. The thorns help protect the cactus from predators and collect moisture from the air.

The proportions of a cactus can differ depending on the species, but it generally has a taller main stem with smaller, shorter branches growing outwards from its sides. The branches, if present, often bend slightly upwards, resembling arms reaching towards the sky.

When trying to draw a cactus, it's important to capture its vertical shape, the presence of thorns throughout the body, and the presence or absence of any branching elements. Remember that cacti can come in various sizes, so the relative proportions may vary, but the overall characteristics mentioned will help convey the essence of this unique plant.
