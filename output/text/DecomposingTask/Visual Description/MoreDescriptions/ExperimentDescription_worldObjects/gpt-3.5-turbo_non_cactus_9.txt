A cactus is a tall, upright plant with a cylindrical or columnar shape. It has a strong, sturdy stem that typically stands vertically. The stem is covered in thick, fleshy, and often sharp spines that protrude outward from the surface. These spines are the most distinctive feature of the cactus.

The proportions of a cactus can vary, but generally, the stem is much taller than it is wide. The spines are distributed along the entire length of the stem, creating a textured appearance. Some cacti may have long, thin spines, while others may have shorter and thicker ones.

When observing a cactus, notice the vertical alignment of the stem, as it typically grows straight upwards towards the sky. The spines may be arranged in clusters or lines along the stem, giving it a unique character. It's important to mention that there are different types of cacti with varying shapes and sizes, but this description covers the fundamental features common to most cacti.

To draw a simplified sketch of a cactus, focus on capturing the tall, upright shape of the stem and the presence of spines. A vertical line representing the stem with small, evenly spaced short lines sticking out along its length can help depict the spines. Remember, the objective is to convey the essence of a cactus rather than intricate details.
