The object I will describe is a cat. 

Fundamental Shape: A cat has a highly recognizable shape. It has a compact, oval-shaped body that is slightly elongated. 

Distinctive Features: A cat has a head with two pointy ears on top. The ears are positioned on either side of the head, a little towards the top. The head has almond-shaped eyes, a small triangular nose in the center, and pointy whiskers on both sides. The body has four legs, each with a rounded paw at the end. At the back, there is a long, thin tail that curves slightly.

Proportions and Alignments: The head is proportionately smaller than the body, but it is positioned at the front of the body. The ears are aligned at the top of the head, near the sides. The eyes are positioned a little below the ears, towards the center of the head. The nose is just below the eyes, and the whiskers extend outwards from each side of the nose. The four legs are evenly spread out, two on each side. The tail starts at the back of the body, extending straight out and then curving downwards.

Relevant Spatial Relationships: The head is positioned at the front of the body, connected by a narrow neck area. The legs are protruding downwards from the body, and the tail is positioned at the back, extending outwards and curving downwards slightly.

Remember, this description is meant to provide the most important visual characteristics of a cat, enabling a blind person to draw a simplified sketch.
