A cat is a small, domesticated mammal with a slender and agile body. Its shape is similar to an elongated oval, with a slightly curved back. It has four legs that are positioned vertically underneath its body, giving it a balanced and stable stance. The head is rounded and sits on top of a graceful neck. 

One of the most distinctive features of a cat is its ears. They are pointed and stand upright on the sides of the head, creating a triangular shape. The eyes are almond-shaped and are located below the ears, slightly towards the front of the face. 

The cat has a long, flexible tail that tapers towards the end. It can be upright or curved, depending on the cat's mood. The tail adds to the cat's overall balance and elegance.

To draw a simplified sketch of a cat, you would start by drawing the basic oval shape for the body. Then, add the legs, positioning them vertically underneath the body evenly. Place the head on top of the body, making sure it is rounded and slightly smaller than the body. Add the pointed ears on the sides of the head, followed by the almond-shaped eyes below the ears. Finally, draw the tail, taking into consideration its length and flexibility.
