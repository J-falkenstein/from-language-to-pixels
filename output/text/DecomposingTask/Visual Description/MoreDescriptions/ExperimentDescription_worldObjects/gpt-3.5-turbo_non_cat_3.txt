A cat is a small, four-legged creature with a flexible body. Its fundamental shape is like an elongated oval when seen from the side. The distinctive features of a cat include pointy ears positioned on top of its head and a long, slender tail that curves gracefully. The head is round with two slanted lines representing the eyes and a small triangular shape for the nose. The eyes are usually almond-shaped. The front legs are shorter than the hind legs, creating a slight slope from the back to the front. The paws have four toes each, with tiny claws hidden within. Overall, a cat has a compact yet agile appearance.
