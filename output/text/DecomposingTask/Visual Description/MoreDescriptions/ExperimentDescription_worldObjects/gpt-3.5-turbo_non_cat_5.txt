A cat is a four-legged animal with a compact, elongated body and a relatively small head. Its basic shape is somewhat like a stretched-out oval, with a rounded back and a curved belly. The head is round and sits on top of the body, with two pointed ears on either side.

The most distinctive feature of a cat is its face, which has two almond-shaped eyes placed relatively close together, typically with vertical pupils. The eyes are positioned towards the front of the head, giving the cat a focused gaze. Above the eyes, there is a set of subtle curved lines representing the cat's eyebrows.

Below the eyes, a small triangular nose is located towards the center of the face. It is positioned slightly above a horizontal line that represents the cat's mouth. The mouth is usually a simple curved line with a small triangle or dot in the center, indicating the cat's nose and mouth respectively.

From the sides of the head, two short lines extend downwards to represent the cat's whiskers. These lines are usually straight and pointed towards the sides. Typically, cats have long whiskers, so they extend beyond the width of the face.

For the body, two parallel curved lines emerge from the bottom of the head, extending towards the back. These lines represent the cat's neck and back, curving slightly upwards. Then, another set of parallel curved lines extends downwards and outwards to represent the cat's chest and belly.

Between the neck and the belly, there are four lines that extend downwards, indicating the cat's legs. Each leg consists of a straight line for the upper leg and a shorter, curved line for the lower leg. At the end of each leg, there are small oval shapes that represent the cat's paws.

Finally, at the back of the body, there is a long, curved line representing the cat's tail. The tail can vary in length, but it typically curves upwards slightly towards the end.

Remember, this description provides a simplified visual representation of a cat, focusing on the essential features needed to recognize the animal.
