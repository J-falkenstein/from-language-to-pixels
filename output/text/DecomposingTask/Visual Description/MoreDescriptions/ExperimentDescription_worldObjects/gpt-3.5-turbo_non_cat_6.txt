A cat is a small, four-legged animal with a slender and curvy body. Its basic shape is similar to an oval, slightly elongated horizontally. The head is round with two small, pointed ears on top, positioned towards the sides. From the head, there is a straight and short neck that connects to the body. 

The most distinctive features of a cat are its eyes and whiskers. The eyes are almond-shaped, positioned towards the front of the head, and they give a sense of alertness. The whiskers are long and extend from either side of the nose, curving slightly outward.

The cat has a long tail that extends from its hindquarters, which helps with balance and communication. It is usually held upright or slightly curved downwards. 

The cat's four legs are relatively short compared to its body. The front legs are slightly shorter than the hind legs. The paws have small, rounded and flexible pads underneath, allowing the cat to move silently.

Overall, a cat has a graceful and agile appearance with its elegant proportions and fluid movements.
