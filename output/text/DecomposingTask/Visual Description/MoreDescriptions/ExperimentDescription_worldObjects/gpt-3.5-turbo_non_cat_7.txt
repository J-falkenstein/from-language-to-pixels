The object I will describe is a cat.

Fundamental shape: The cat has a slender and elongated body. Its shape can be described as a combination of curves and straight lines. The body starts with a rounded head and narrows down to a sleek neck. From there, it continues into a slightly curved back, forming an arch. The back then slopes gently downwards towards the tail, which is long and thin.

Distinctive features: The cat has two pointy ears located on top of its head. The ears are upright and slightly tilted forward. On the front of the head, there are two almond-shaped eyes positioned horizontally. The eyes are often vivid and expressive. In the center of the face, there is a small, triangular-shaped nose. Just below the nose, there is a tiny curved line that represents the mouth. Above the eyes, there are short, thin whiskers that extend outwards.

Proportions and spatial relationships: The head is relatively small compared to the body, giving the cat a sleek appearance. The neck is proportionate to the head and connects seamlessly to the body. The legs are positioned towards the lower part of the body, with the front legs shorter than the hind legs. The front paws have small oval-shaped pads, while the hind paws are larger and cylindrical in shape. The tail extends from the end of the back, reaching down towards the ground.

Keep in mind that these descriptions are meant to give a general idea of what a cat looks like, focusing on the most important features for recognition.
