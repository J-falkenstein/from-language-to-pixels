A cat is a small, four-legged animal commonly kept as a pet. The fundamental shape of a cat is similar to a rectangle with rounded edges. Starting from the top, imagine an elongated oval for the head, slightly narrower in the middle. The body is rectangular, straight and parallel to the ground, but with a curvy silhouette. The tail extends from the back, curving upwards and tapering towards the end. 

Moving to the head, the cat has two pointy, triangular ears positioned on top, facing forward. Below the ears, there are two almond-shaped eyes, usually reflective and often described as slit-like. These eyes are placed mid-way on the head, slightly closer to the ears. Between them, a small triangular nose is positioned, pointing downwards. Underneath the nose, there's a small, horizontal line that indicates the cat's mouth. 

Furthermore, the cat has four legs, two in the front and two in the back. Each leg consists of a vertical line that splits into two at the bottom to represent the paws. The front legs are slightly shorter than the back ones. The cat's paws can be depicted as rounded shapes. 

It's important to note that a cat's size and proportions can vary, so make sure to adjust the length and size of different parts according to the cat you have in mind. Ultimately, these simplified descriptions should help a blind person to create a recognizable sketch of a cat.
