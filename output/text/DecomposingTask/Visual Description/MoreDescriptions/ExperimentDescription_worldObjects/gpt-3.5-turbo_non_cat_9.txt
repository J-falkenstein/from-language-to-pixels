A cat is a small and compact animal with a relatively round-shaped body. Starting from the head, it has two pointy ears that are positioned on the top sides of its head. The ears are slightly taller than they are wide and slant slightly forward. Between the ears, there is a small space that forms the forehead. 

Below the forehead, you'll notice two almond-shaped eyes, one on each side of the face. These eyes are positioned horizontally and are usually bright and alert. They sit just above the cat's nose, which is a small triangle shape that protrudes slightly from the face. The nose is located centrally between the eyes and is slightly higher than the mouth. 

Moving down from the nose, there is a small, curved mouth that forms an upside-down "U" shape. This mouth is located at the bottom center of the face. On either side of the mouth, you can find a set of pointy whiskers that extend horizontally. 

From the head, the cat's body extends downward, forming a slightly elongated oval shape. The neck is not very long but connects seamlessly with the body. The cat has four legs, two on each side, which are positioned vertically. These legs are proportionate to the body and typically end with small paws. 

Lastly, at the back of the body, there is a long, tapering tail that curves slightly upwards towards the end. The tail is thin and flexible, and its length is roughly half the length of the cat's body.
