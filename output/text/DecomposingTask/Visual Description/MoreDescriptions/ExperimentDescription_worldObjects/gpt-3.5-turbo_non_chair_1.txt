A chair is a piece of furniture that you can sit on. Its fundamental shape is like a rectangle or square. The seat is usually flat and horizontal, providing a surface to sit on. At the back of the seat, there is a vertical support, forming a straight line. This line extends upwards to create a backrest, allowing you to lean comfortably. The backrest may have additional features like curves or straight lines for added support. 

On either side of the seat, there are vertical posts or legs that help maintain the chair's stability. These posts are usually evenly spaced and parallel to each other, forming the sides of the chair. They connect to a horizontal support at the bottom, creating the chair's base.

The proportions of a chair can vary, but generally, the height of the seat is positioned at a comfortable level for sitting. The backrest is taller than the seat, allowing for back support. The width of the seat is wide enough to accommodate a person comfortably.

When you sit on a chair, the seat is typically positioned horizontally, parallel to the floor. The backrest is aligned vertically, offering support to your back. The legs of the chair touch the floor, providing stability.

Overall, a chair has a simple and functional design, consisting of a seat, a backrest, and legs. The key features to remember are the rectangular or square shape, the vertical backrest, and the parallel legs.
