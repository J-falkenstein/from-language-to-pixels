The chair is a basic piece of furniture that is typically used for sitting. It consists of a seat and a backrest. The fundamental shape of a chair is usually rectangular or square. The seat is flat and parallel to the ground, providing a surface to rest upon. It is positioned at a comfortable height for sitting.

The backrest is a vertical piece that extends upward from the back of the seat. It is attached to the seat at a right angle, creating a supportive structure to lean against. The height of the backrest can vary, with some chairs having taller or shorter backrests.

One distinct feature of a chair is the presence of four legs. These legs are attached to the corners of the seat and extend downward towards the ground. They are typically straight and vertical, providing stability to the chair. The legs are evenly spaced apart, creating a balanced foundation for the chair.

The proportions of a chair can vary, but generally, the height of the seat is around knee-level when one is standing. The backrest is positioned at a comfortable height for back support.

When describing a chair to a blind person, it would be important to emphasize the rectangular or square shape of the seat and the vertical backrest. Additionally, you could mention the presence of four legs that extend downward from the seat. Describing the position of the seat in relation to the ground and the backrest in relation to the seat can also provide a clearer understanding.
