The object I will describe is a chair.

A chair is a piece of furniture that is designed for sitting. Its fundamental shape is generally rectangular or square. The chair consists of a seat, a backrest, and four legs. The seat is a flat surface that is slightly curved to provide comfort. It is usually positioned at a height that allows for easy sitting and standing.

The backrest is attached to the seat and is vertically oriented, providing support to the back. It is usually taller than the seat and may have a slight curve to match the natural shape of the spine. The backrest is positioned in the rear center of the seat.

The legs of the chair are typically straight and vertical, providing stability. Each leg is placed at one of the four corners of the seat, forming a rectangular base. The legs are evenly spaced and have approximately the same length, ensuring balance.

To give the blind person an idea of proportions, the seat is wider than the backrest, and the backrest is taller than the seat. The legs extend downward from each corner of the seat, reaching the floor.

Overall, a chair can be recognized by its rectangular or square shape, distinct seat, backrest, and four legs. It is important to note that there are various designs and styles of chairs, but the mentioned features should help the blind person create a simplified sketch of a chair.
