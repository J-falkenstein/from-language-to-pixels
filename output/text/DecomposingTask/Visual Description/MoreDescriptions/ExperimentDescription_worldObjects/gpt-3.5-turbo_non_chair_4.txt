A chair is a common piece of furniture used for sitting. It has a basic shape of a rectangle with a tall, straight backrest and a horizontal seat that is slightly curved upward at the front. The backrest is usually centrally positioned behind the seat. The seat is wider than the backrest and may have armrests attached on either side. The legs of the chair are typically four vertical supports, positioned at each corner, evenly spaced. The back legs are parallel to each other and aligned with the backrest, while the front legs are also parallel to each other and slightly inclined towards the back legs. The seat is elevated from the ground by the legs, providing a comfortable sitting position. Chairs can come in various materials, colors, and styles, but these fundamental features are generally consistent across different types of chairs.
