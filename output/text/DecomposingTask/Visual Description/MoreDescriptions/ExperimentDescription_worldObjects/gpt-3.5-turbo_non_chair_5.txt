A chair is a basic piece of furniture used for sitting. It typically consists of a seat, a backrest, and four legs. The shape of the chair can be described as rectangular with rounded corners. The seat is flat and horizontal, usually wider at the front and tapering towards the back. The backrest is vertical and positioned at the rear of the seat, rising above it. It can be rectangular or curved, depending on the design. The legs of the chair are vertical and evenly spaced, supporting the seat and creating stability. They are typically positioned at each corner and aligned with the edges of the seat. The relationship between the seat and the legs creates a slight gap underneath the chair. The dimensions of a chair can vary, but the key factors are the seat height, which determines how high or low one sits, and the backrest height, which provides support. The key features to recognize a chair include its seat, backrest, four legs, and the rectangular shape formed by these elements.
