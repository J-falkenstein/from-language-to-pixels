A chair is a rectangular object that consists of a seat, a backrest, and four legs. The seat is typically flat and wide, providing a surface for sitting. It is positioned horizontally and attached to the legs, which are situated at each corner of the seat. The legs are vertical and straight, supporting the weight of the chair. 

The backrest is located at one end of the seat, rising vertically and offering support for the back. It may have a curved or straight shape, depending on the design. The backrest is connected to the seat, usually at a right angle, providing stability to the structure.

The most distinctive feature of a chair is its ability to provide a comfortable place to sit. The seat and backrest are often padded or made of materials that offer some cushioning. However, these details are not necessary for recognizing the object.

To help the blind person in drawing a simplified sketch of a chair, you can emphasize the rectangular shape and the clear distinction between the seat, backrest, and legs. Additionally, you can indicate the right angles formed where the seat meets the legs and where the backrest meets the seat.
