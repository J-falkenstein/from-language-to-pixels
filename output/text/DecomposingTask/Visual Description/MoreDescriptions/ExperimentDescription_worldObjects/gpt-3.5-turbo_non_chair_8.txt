The object I will describe is a chair. A chair typically has a rectangle-shaped seat that is slightly wider in the front and narrower in the back. The backrest is positioned vertically behind the seat, resembling a straight line. At the top of the backrest, there might be a slight curve or a horizontal bar connecting both sides. Moving down from the seat, there are four legs that are positioned at equal distances from each other, forming a square or rectangular base. The legs are typically vertical and straight, extending from the seat to the ground. The front legs are usually aligned with the front edge of the seat, while the back legs align with the rear edge. The proportions of the legs are usually similar, with the front legs being slightly shorter than the back legs, creating a slight backward tilt. These features, along with the distinct shape of a seat and backrest, are the most important aspects to recognize a chair.
