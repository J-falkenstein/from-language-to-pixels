A chair is a piece of furniture that is commonly used for seating. It typically consists of a seat, backrest, and four legs. The fundamental shape of a chair is rectangular with a slightly curved or contoured seat. The backrest is vertical and attached to the rear of the seat, providing support for the back. The legs are positioned at each corner of the seat and extend vertically downward. 

Distinctive features of a chair include the seat height, which is positioned at a convenient height for sitting, allowing the feet to rest comfortably on the floor. The backrest is usually higher than the seat and often slightly angled backward for added comfort. The front legs are generally shorter than the back legs, resulting in a slight incline to the seat. 

Spatially, the seat is positioned at the topmost part of the chair, with the backrest located behind it. The legs are evenly spaced and aligned with the corners of the seat, providing stability and support. The relationship between the seat and backrest is perpendicular, forming a right angle. 

Overall, a chair can be recognized by its basic rectangular shape, with a seat, backrest, and four legs. The seat's height, the curvature of the backrest, and the alignment of the legs with the seat are key elements to consider when creating a simplified sketch.
