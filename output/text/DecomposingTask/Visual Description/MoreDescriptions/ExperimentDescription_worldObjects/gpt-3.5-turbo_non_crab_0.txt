The crab has a roundish body with a slightly flattened top and bottom. The top part, known as the carapace, is wider and longer than the bottom part. It has a distinct curvy shape. 

Starting from the center of the carapace, there are two pairs of long, slender legs that extend outward. These legs are evenly spaced apart and are jointed, allowing the crab to move sideways. Just below the carapace, you can find a smaller pair of legs called the pincers or claws. These pincers are more robust and have a noticeable hook-like shape at the end.

Beneath the carapace, towards the front, there are two round, stalked eyes. They are positioned on small mounds. Below the eyes, you will find the mouth, which is a small, triangular opening.

Towards the bottom of the crab's body, there is a flattened, slightly curved abdomen. This part is narrower than the carapace and consists of several segments.

Overall, the crab's shape is distinct and recognizable, with its roundish body, long legs extending outwards, and the presence of pincers or claws near the front.
