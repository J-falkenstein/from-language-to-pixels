A crab is a sea creature that has a distinct shape and features. Imagine a roundish body with a hard shell that is divided into two parts, similar to a protective jacket. The top part, called the carapace, is wider and flatter, while the bottom part, called the abdomen, is smaller and narrower.

At the front of the crab, there are two large and elongated pincers, which are its main defining feature. These pincers have jagged edges and are used by the crab for various purposes, like catching prey and defending itself. One of the pincers is usually larger and more powerful than the other.

Behind the pincers, you can find the crab's eyes, which are situated on small stalks. These eyes are round and protrude slightly from the sides of the crab's carapace. Additionally, at the front, below the eyes, there are two sets of small appendages, known as antennae, which help the crab sense its surroundings.

The crab's legs are situated on either side of its body. It has a total of eight legs, with the front pair being adapted into claws or pincers. The other six legs are used for walking and have smaller pointed tips. The legs are attached to the sides of the crab's carapace.

Lastly, the crab's overall proportions are such that its body is wider than it is tall, and its legs, particularly the front pair, extend forward, giving the appearance of a sideways crawl.

When a blind person sketches a crab based on these descriptions, they should focus on capturing the roundish body with a divided shell, the two large pincers, the eyes on stalks, the antennae, and the eight legs, with the front pair being larger and claw-like.
