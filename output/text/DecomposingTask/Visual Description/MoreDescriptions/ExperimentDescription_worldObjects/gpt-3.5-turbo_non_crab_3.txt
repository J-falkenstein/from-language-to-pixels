The object is a crab. It has a roundish and slightly flattened body. 

Starting from the center, imagine two curved lines that extend outwards forming the crab's wide, roundish shell. The shell has a slightly jagged edge, representing its texture.

On the front side of the crab's body, there are two large, distinctive pincers that curve inward towards each other. These pincers are located near the top of the body and are unequal in size, with one usually being larger than the other. They are used for grabbing and protecting the crab.

Beneath the pincers, towards the bottom of the body, imagine six legs that extend downward. These legs are jointed and slightly curved, being thinner towards the end.

Towards the back of the body, there is a smaller, fan-shaped structure called the tail. It is positioned below the curved shell and can be slightly curved upwards.

Overall, the crab's body has a symmetrical appearance, with the pincers and legs positioned around the central body.

Remember to emphasize the roundish and wide shape of the body, the curved pincers, and the presence of multiple legs. Mention that the crab has a shell, pincers, legs, and a tail, focusing on their relative positions and shapes.
