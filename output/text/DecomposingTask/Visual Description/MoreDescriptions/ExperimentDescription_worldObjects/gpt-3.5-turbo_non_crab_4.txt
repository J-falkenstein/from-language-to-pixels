A crab has a roundish, oval-shaped body with a rigid shell covering its back. The shell is sort of like a sideways teardrop, wider at the front and tapering towards the back. Its body is divided into two parts - the larger front portion which has two big pincers or claws, and the smaller rear portion where its legs are attached.

The front part of the crab, called the cephalothorax, has a pair of eyes that stick out on stalks, helping the crab see in different directions. Just below the eyes, there are two shorter antennae that the crab uses to feel and detect things around it. Additionally, the crab's mouth is located between the two antennae.

Moving down to the claws, they are quite prominent and can be larger in size. One claw is usually larger than the other, used for gripping and defending itself. The shape of the claws often resembles a rounded triangle or a curvy paddle. On the inner side of the claws, there are little spikes that can be used for crushing or cutting.

On the back of the crab, you may notice some patterns or textures on the shell. These patterns can vary depending on the species of crab but are not essential for recognizing the general shape of the crab. 

Lastly, the legs of the crab extend from the smaller rear portion of its body. There are typically eight legs, four on each side, lined up one after the other. These legs are jointed and somewhat slender, and they help the crab scuttle and move around in various directions.
