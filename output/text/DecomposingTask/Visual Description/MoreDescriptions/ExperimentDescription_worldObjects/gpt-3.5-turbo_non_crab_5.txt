The object is a crab. It has a round and slightly flat shape, resembling a circle that has been squished from the top and bottom. The most distinctive feature of a crab is its hard outer shell, which covers its body like armor. The shell is divided into two parts: the larger, rounded top called the carapace, and the smaller, flatter bottom called the abdomen. 

Positioned at the front of the carapace, there are two large, protruding eyes on stalks. They are positioned on either side and are quite noticeable. Just below these eyes, there are two pairs of small, pointed projections. These serve as the crab's antennas and help it detect its surroundings. 

On either side of the carapace, you will find a set of five pairs of legs. The front pair of legs has one claw-like structure on the end, while the other legs are smaller and more slender. These legs help the crab move and manipulate objects. 

At the rear of the crab's body, you can notice a small fan-shaped tail called the abdomen. The abdomen is folded underneath the carapace, and its edges are visible from the sides. It differs in size and shape compared to the carapace. 

Overall, the crab has a distinct shape with a round, squished appearance. It has a hard shell with a large carapace and a smaller abdomen. The eyes, antennas, legs, and tail are the key features that differentiate a crab from other creatures.
