A crab is a small sea creature with a distinct appearance. Its overall shape is similar to a rounded triangle when viewed from above. The body of a crab is compact and slightly flattened. 

Starting from the front, the crab has a pair of long and sturdy pincers called claws. These claws are positioned towards the front of the crab's body and are used for various purposes such as defense and capturing prey. They have a curved shape and are thicker towards the base, tapering towards the end.

Moving towards the center of the body, you'll notice a series of segments arranged in a line. These segments create a distinctive pattern on the crab's carapace, which is the hard shell covering its body. The pattern may vary depending on the species, but it often appears as a combination of raised lines and bumps that form a symmetrical pattern.

At the rear end of the crab's body, there is a wider segment called the abdomen. The abdomen is often more rounded compared to the rest of the body. It is typically flexible and can be curled underneath the crab's carapace for protection.

When viewed from the side, the body of the crab curves downwards towards the ground. The legs of a crab are positioned along the sides of the body, typically in a symmetrical pattern. Each leg has joints that allow for movement and ends with a small pincer-like structure.

Overall, a crab has a compact and rounded triangular shape with a hard carapace adorned with a symmetrical pattern of raised lines and bumps. It has long and sturdy claws at the front, multiple segments along the body with legs attached, and a rounded abdomen towards the rear.
