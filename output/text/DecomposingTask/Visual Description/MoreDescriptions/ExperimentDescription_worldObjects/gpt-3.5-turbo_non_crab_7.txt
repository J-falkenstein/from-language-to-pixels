A crab is a small creature with a rounded, slightly oval-shaped body. Its body is divided into two main parts: the front part, called the cephalothorax, and the rear part, called the abdomen. The cephalothorax is wider and more compact, while the abdomen is narrower and elongated.

At the front of the crab, you will find its distinctive pair of pincers, called chelipeds. These chelipeds are usually larger than the other legs and have a jagged appearance, perfect for grabbing and holding onto things. One of the chelipeds is usually larger than the other, forming a noticeable size difference that helps with identification.

On the cephalothorax, you can also spot two big eyes, positioned on stalks. These eyes are commonly round and protrude outward, allowing the crab to have a wide field of vision. Just below the eyes, there are a pair of smaller antennae that help the crab sense its surroundings.

Moving towards the back of the crab, you'll notice four pairs of walking legs. These legs are slender and jointed, allowing the crab to scuttle and move sideways. The first pair of walking legs is often modified to form small pincers, which are not as large or prominent as the chelipeds but still serve a similar purpose.

When it comes to proportions, the chelipeds are usually the most eye-catching feature, followed by the combination of the cephalothorax and abdomen. The legs are relatively long compared to the body, and they play a significant role in the crab's movement.
