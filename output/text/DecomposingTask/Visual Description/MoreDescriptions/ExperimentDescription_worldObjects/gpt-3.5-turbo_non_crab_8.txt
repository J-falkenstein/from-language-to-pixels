A crab is a small creature with a roundish body and a hard shell called a carapace. The carapace is curved on the top and flat on the bottom. It is wider at the front and tapers towards the back. On the front of the crab, there are two large pincers or claws that are used for grabbing and defending. These claws are typically asymmetrical, with one being larger and bulkier than the other. The eyes of the crab are located on stalks and are positioned on the upper sides of the carapace. They are usually round and protruding. The legs of the crab are jointed and segmented, with each leg having small pincers at the end. The legs are arranged in a way that allows the crab to move sideways. The overall shape of the crab can be described as compact and low to the ground. It is important to note that crabs come in different sizes and colors, but these basic features are common to most crabs.
