A crab is a small sea creature with a distinct shape that is often associated with sideways movement. The body of a crab is round and compact, somewhat resembling a circle. It has a hard, protective exoskeleton that covers its body, giving it a sturdy appearance. Imagine a circular shape slightly elongated horizontally.

On the top of the crab's body, you will notice a pair of large, pincer-like claws that serve many purposes, such as defense and capturing food. These claws have a noticeable gap between them when closed. They extend outward from the front of the body, giving the crab a distinguishable frontal shape. Picture two elongated triangles pointing away from the body, meeting at the tips.

Behind the claws, there are a series of smaller legs on either side. These legs are jointed, allowing the crab to scuttle sideways. Each leg has pointed tips and is arranged alternately along the sides of the crab's body. The legs start shorter near the front and gradually increase in length towards the back of the body, creating a slight gradient in size. Imagine a row of small, segmented rectangles aligned next to each other.

Moving closer to the rear of the crab's body, there is a broad and flattened section that tapers into a point. This is the tail or abdomen of the crab. It is narrower than the body and often held tucked under the crab's body. Picture a slightly elongated oval shape that is connected to the body but distinctively separate.

Although the description above is simplified, it highlights the key features that help recognize a crab. Remember, proportions and sizes can vary among different crab species, but the overall shape and arrangement of these features are commonly observed.
