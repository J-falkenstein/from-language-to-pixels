The crown is a circular object that sits on top of a person's head, resembling a round and curved band. Its most important feature is the pointed, triangular shapes that extend upward from the circular base. These pointed shapes are evenly spaced around the circular band, creating a distinctive pattern. The height of these points is usually taller than the circular band itself, giving the crown a regal appearance. The circular band is smooth and seamless, and it encircles the head, resting securely on the person's forehead and extending towards the back of the head. The proportions of the points are equal, ensuring a balanced and symmetrical design. The crown's main spatial relationship lies in its alignment with the person's head, perfectly centered and fitting snugly.
