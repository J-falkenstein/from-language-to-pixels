A crown is a circular or slightly curved object that is typically worn on the head. Its shape resembles a wide band or a ring. The crown is usually made of metal, such as gold or silver, and is adorned with various jewels or decorative elements. 

Starting from the base of the crown, which rests on the head, it gradually widens towards the top. The circumference of the crown remains fairly consistent, providing a complete circle around the head. 

At the top of the crown, there is a central point or a peak that rises slightly higher than the rest of the structure. Often, this central point is decorated with a large jewel, feather, or emblem, which adds to the regal appearance. 

Moving to the sides of the crown, there are typically arches or points that extend outward symmetrically from the base. These arches or points are evenly spaced around the circumference of the crown, creating a balanced and symmetrical design. 

The overall height and size of the crown can vary depending on its purpose. For example, some crowns may be tall and intricate, symbolizing royalty or high status, while others may be smaller and simpler, representing a more modest position. 

While describing the crown's shape and distinctive features, it is important to note that crowns can vary in design and style across different cultures and historical periods. The description provided here is a general overview of a crown's visual characteristics.
