A crown is a circular object that sits on top of someone's head. It has a dome-like shape, resembling an upside-down bowl. The bottom of the crown is flat, allowing it to rest comfortably on the head. The most distinctive feature of a crown is its pointed peaks that rise up from the circular base. These peaks are evenly spaced around the circumference of the crown, creating a symmetrical pattern. The peaks are usually taller in the center and gradually decrease in height towards the sides. They resemble small, triangular shapes sticking out from the circular base. The crown's proportion is such that the height of the peaks is greater than the height of the circular base. This creates a visually striking silhouette with the peaks prominently visible. Although there are no alignments or specific spatial relationships with other elements, it is important to note that a crown is typically worn by someone, so it is positioned on top of their head, aligning with the person's hairline.
