A crown is a symbolic headpiece usually worn by royalty or important figures. Its fundamental shape is circular, resembling a round band that wraps around the head. At the top of the crown, there is a central point or peak that extends upward, often resembling a small tower or spire.

Distinctive features of a crown may include intricate designs or patterns adorning its surface. These decorations are typically made of precious metals like gold or silver and may include gemstones or pearls for added elegance. The band of the crown may have a slightly curved or scalloped pattern, adding a regal touch.

Proportions-wise, the central peak of the crown usually rises taller than the rest of the band, creating a focal point. The width of the band is typically wider towards the bottom, gradually narrowing towards the top. This design adds a sense of balance and stability to the overall structure.

When describing the crown's spatial relationships, you can mention that the band rests directly on top of the head, encircling it in a horizontal manner. The central peak rises vertically from the band, giving the crown a sense of height. The band may have an alignment with the wearer's forehead, sitting just above the eyebrows.

It's important to note that these descriptions may vary depending on specific crown designs from different cultures or time periods.
