A crown is a circular object, slightly flattened at the top. It has a distinct curving and tapering shape, resembling a wide band that sits on top of the head. Imagine a simple circular ring that has been stretched vertically.

The most distinctive feature of a crown is its pointed spikes or peaks that rise upwards from the circular band. These spikes are evenly spaced around the circumference of the crown, creating a regal and majestic appearance. They are tall and thin, resembling sharp triangles pointing towards the sky.

The base of a crown, where it rests on the head, is wider and rounded to ensure a comfortable fit. The spikes begin to emerge from this rounded base, extending upward in a symmetric manner. Each spike is similar in length, giving the crown a balanced and symmetrical look.

The size of the spikes should be proportional to the overall height of the crown. They should be long enough to be noticeable but not too large as to overpower the circular band. The height and width of the band can vary but should maintain a consistent thickness throughout.

When drawing a crown, ensure the circular band is evenly rounded and connect the spikes to this band at regular intervals. Pay attention to the height and shape of the spikes, maintaining their triangular form. The overall sketch should convey a circular base with tall, pointed spikes rising from it.
