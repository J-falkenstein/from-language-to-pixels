A crown is a circular object that sits on top of a person's head. It is usually made of gold or another shiny material and has a distinct shape that resembles a tall, pointed hat. The overall shape of a crown is conical, with a wider base that gradually narrows towards the top. The base of the crown is typically adorned with various decorative elements, such as gemstones or intricate metalwork, which enhance its regal appearance.

At the top of the crown, there is a central point that extends upwards. This point is usually more pronounced than the rest of the crown and gives it a majestic look. The height of the crown can vary, but it is generally taller than the width.

When looking at the crown from the front, there is often a prominent arch shape that spans from one side to the other. This arch is usually positioned slightly above the wearer's forehead and adds elegance to the overall design. Along the arch, there may be additional decorative elements or patterns that enhance the crown's beauty.

To help you understand the proportions, the base of the crown is wider than the wearer's head and extends slightly beyond the sides. The overall size of the crown is typically tailored to fit comfortably on a person's head, with the bottom edges resting just above the ears.

In summary, a crown is a circular object with a conical shape, featuring a distinct central point at the top and a wider base adorned with decorative elements. It has a tall and regal appearance, with a prominent arch shape along the front, and is typically worn on top of a person's head.
