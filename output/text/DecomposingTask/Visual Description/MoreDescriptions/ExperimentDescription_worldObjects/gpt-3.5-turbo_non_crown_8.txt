A crown is a symbolic headpiece that is often worn by royalty or to represent authority. It is typically circular in shape, resembling a thin and wide band that wraps around the head. The circular part of the crown, called the base, sits on top of the head and is usually wider at the front and narrower at the back.

The most distinctive feature of a crown is its adorned top, which is positioned at the front. This top part is often raised and decorated with various elements such as jewels, gemstones, or intricate metal designs. These decorative elements can take the form of spikes, crosses, or other symbolic shapes.

The base of the crown may also have additional embellishments, such as engravings or patterns, that enhance its regal appearance. The overall shape of the crown is often symmetrical and balanced, with the front center aligning with the forehead and the back extending towards the nape of the neck.

When holding the crown, you would notice that it is lightweight and made of precious metals like gold or silver. Its size can vary depending on the wearer, but generally, a crown is proportional to the head, fitting snugly and comfortably.

In summary, a crown is a circular headpiece with a wide front and a narrower back. Its most recognizable features are the adorned top, usually positioned towards the front, and the base that wraps around the head. The crown symbolizes power, authority, and royalty, making it instantly recognizable.
