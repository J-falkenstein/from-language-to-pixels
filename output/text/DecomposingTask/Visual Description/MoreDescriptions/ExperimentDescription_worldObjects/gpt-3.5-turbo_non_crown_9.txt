A crown is a circular or semi-circular object worn on the head, typically made of metal or adorned with jewels. It sits horizontally on the head, with the top part known as the "band" resting directly on the forehead. The band curves around the head, creating a rounded shape that gradually becomes narrower towards the back.

On the front of the crown, there is a central element called the "frontlet" or "jewel crest." This part is often taller than the rest of the crown and may be decorated with intricate designs, gemstones, or symbols that indicate royalty or significance. The frontlet is positioned above the forehead, centered on the band.

Radiating outwards from the frontlet are metal or jeweled "spikes" or "points," which can vary in number and length. These spikes are evenly spaced around the crown and point upwards, giving the crown a regal appearance.

The overall shape of the crown can be described as a rounded band with a tall frontlet in the center and spikes extending upward from it. The crown is generally symmetrical and follows the natural contour of the head, allowing for a comfortable fit.
