This object is called a cup. It has a simple, cylindrical shape with a round opening at the top. The cup is wider at the top and tapers down towards the bottom. It has a curved handle attached to one side, which sticks out horizontally from the body of the cup. The handle is typically positioned opposite to the cup's opening. The cup is usually small enough to hold in one hand and has a flat base for stability when placed on a surface.
