The cup is a cylindrical object with a round base and an open top. It has a tall and straight body that gradually narrows towards the top. The most distinctive feature of the cup is its handle, which is attached to one side of the body. The handle is shaped like a curved hook and extends outwards from the body at a slight angle. It is positioned towards the top half of the cup and is used for gripping and holding. The cup is proportionate, with the handle aligning vertically with the body. The spatial relationship between the handle and the body is such that the handle is positioned opposite to the opening of the cup, helping in easy access to the liquid inside.
