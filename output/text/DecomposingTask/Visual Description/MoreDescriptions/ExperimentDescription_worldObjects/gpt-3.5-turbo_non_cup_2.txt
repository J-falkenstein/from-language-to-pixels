The cup is a cylindrical object with a round base and an open top. It is usually held upright with the base resting on a surface. The height of the cup is about twice the width of the base. On the outside, there is a handle attached to one side, slightly curved and protruding outwards. The handle is positioned about 1/3 of the way up from the base towards the top. The cup's rim is smooth and circular, running along the open top. The sides of the cup are straight and vertical, leading down to the rounded base. Overall, the cup has a symmetric and balanced appearance, with the handle providing a distinguishable feature.
