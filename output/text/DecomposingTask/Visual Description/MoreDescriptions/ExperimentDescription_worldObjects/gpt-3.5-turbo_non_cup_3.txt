Distinctive features of the cup include its handle and the presence of a curved rim at the top. The handle is attached to the side of the cup, opposite the rim, and extends outwards. It has an elongated shape, similar to an arch, allowing for a comfortable grip. The curved rim forms a circular opening at the top, providing a place for liquid to be poured in or sipped from.

When drawing the cup, it is important to position the handle on the side, slightly below the top edge of the cup. The handle is aligned vertically with the cup's body. The rim is located at the top of the cup, creating a clean edge that is parallel to the base.

In summary, the cup is a cylindrical object with a round base and an open top. It has a handle on one side and a curved rim at the top.
