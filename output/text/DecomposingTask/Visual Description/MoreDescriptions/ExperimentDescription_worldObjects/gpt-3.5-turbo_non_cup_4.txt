The cup is a cylindrical object with a circular base and an open top. It has a tall, slender shape with straight sides that slightly taper inward towards the bottom. The diameter of the base is slightly smaller than the diameter of the top rim. The cup has a handle attached to one side, which is usually curved and provides a grip for holding the cup comfortably. The handle is positioned horizontally, aligned with the upper portion of the cup. When holding the cup upright, the handle is typically on the right side. On the opposite side of the handle, there is a small gap or opening that allows liquids to be poured into the cup easily. Overall, the cup appears symmetrical, with a smooth and uniform surface. Its distinctiveness lies in its cylindrical shape with a narrow base, an open top, and a handle on one side.
