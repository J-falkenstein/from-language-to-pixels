The cup is a cylindrical object with a wide circular opening at the top and a narrower base at the bottom. The overall shape is like a slightly elongated cylinder. The distinctive feature of a cup is its handle, which is usually attached to the side. The handle is like a curved appendage that sticks out from the main body of the cup. It is positioned towards one side of the cup and is often aligned with the upper half of the cup's height. The handle is usually parallel to the opening of the cup, making it easier to hold and grip. When holding the cup, the handle is positioned above the body of the cup, allowing the person's fingers to comfortably fit around it. The spatial relationship of the handle is important for the cup's functionality, as it enables the person to hold and lift the cup without burning their hands or spilling its contents. The proportions of the cup may vary, but the handle is typically of a size that can accommodate several fingers. When drawing the cup, focus on capturing the main cylindrical shape and the presence of the handle, as these are the key elements that make it recognizable.
