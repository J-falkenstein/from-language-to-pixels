Sure! Here is a visual description of a cup:

A cup is a cylindrical object with a rounded bottom and an open top. It typically has a handle on one side for easy holding. The main body of the cup is tall and slightly wider at the top than at the bottom. The top rim is smooth and circular, while the bottom is flat and stable. The handle is usually attached to the side of the cup near the top, curving upwards, allowing for a comfortable grip. The handle aligns parallel to the cup's main body and is positioned opposite to where the cup curves outward. The size of the cup can vary, but it is generally small enough to be held in one hand.
