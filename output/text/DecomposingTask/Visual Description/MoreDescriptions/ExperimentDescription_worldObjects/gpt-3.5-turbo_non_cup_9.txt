The cup is a cylindrical object with a curved bottom that allows it to stand upright. Its primary shape is like a vertical tube with a slightly flared opening at the top. The cup has a handle on one side, which is typically a curved appendage extending from the body of the cup near the top. The handle provides a space for fingers to grip and hold the cup. The proportion of the handle is usually smaller than the body of the cup, creating a visual contrast. The cup's opening is circular and serves as the entrance for liquids. It is situated on the topmost part of the cup, aligned with the center of the cylindrical body. The height of the cup is generally greater than its width, but the exact proportions may vary based on the specific cup. The cup's body, handle, and opening are all connected seamlessly, forming a cohesive and functional object.
