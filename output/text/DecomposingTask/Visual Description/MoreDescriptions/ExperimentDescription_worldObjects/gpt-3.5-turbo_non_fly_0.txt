The object I will describe is a fly.

Fundamental Shape: A fly has a compact body with a slightly oval shape.

Distinctive Features: 

1. Head: The fly's head is small and rounded, with a pair of large compound eyes that cover most of its surface. There are also short, bristly antennae protruding from the top of the head.
2. Wings: Fly has two translucent wings that are longer than its body. These wings are narrow and have a veined pattern, giving them a delicate appearance.
3. Abdomen: The abdomen of a fly is elongated and segmented, tapering towards the back. It might be helpful to mention that the abdomen is larger than the head and thorax.
4. Legs: A fly has six long and slender legs. The front legs are often the shortest, while the middle and hind legs are comparatively longer.

Proportions and Spatial Relationships: The compound eyes sit on either side of the head, and the antennae are relatively short, extending slightly beyond the eyes. The wings extend past the length of the body, and when at rest, they are folded neatly on top of each other. The legs are attached to the thorax, with the front legs being the closest to the head.

To summarize, a fly can be represented as having a compact, slightly oval body with a small rounded head. Its distinctive features include large compound eyes, short antennae, translucent veined wings longer than its body, a segmented abdomen, and six long legs. Remember, the above description aims to convey the essential visual characteristics of a fly.
