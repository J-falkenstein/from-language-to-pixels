The object you are describing is a fly. It is a small insect with a distinctive shape and features. The fundamental shape of a fly can be described as elongated and slender. It has a narrow body that tapers towards the end. 

One of the most important features of a fly is its wings. They are typically transparent and slightly longer than its body. The wings are attached to the side of the fly's body and are positioned horizontally when the fly is at rest. They extend outwards from the body, resembling an airplane's wingspan.

The head of a fly is proportionally larger than its body and is connected to the body by a thin neck. The head has two large, compound eyes that occupy a significant portion of its surface. These eyes are usually dark in color, resembling multiple tiny facets.

Below the eyes, you will find a small, tubular structure called a proboscis. The proboscis is used by the fly for feeding. It is typically coiled up when not in use and extends forward when the fly is feeding.

The fly also has six thin, spindly legs that are attached to its thorax, which is the middle part of its body. These legs are used for walking, climbing, and gripping surfaces. They are positioned in a way that allows the fly to maintain balance while in motion.

Overall, the fly can be recognized by its slender, elongated body, transparent wings, large compound eyes, and the presence of a proboscis and six thin legs.
