The object you are trying to draw is a fly. 

A fly is a small insect with a compact body. Its fundamental shape is somewhat oval or egg-like. The body consists of three distinct parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. 

Starting with the head, it is round and a tad smaller in proportion to the rest of the body. At the front of the head, you will find two large compound eyes, which are round and occupy a significant portion of the head's surface. Between the compound eyes, there is a smaller space where a pair of small antennae emerge. 

Moving to the thorax, it is slightly elongated and connects the head to the abdomen. On the thorax, you will notice six thin and jointed legs, three on each side. These legs help the fly move around. 

Finally, the abdomen is the third part of the body. It is slightly larger and more elongated than the thorax. The abdomen tapers towards the end, giving it a more streamlined appearance. 

Although flies have wings, these are not essential for their recognition as drawings aim to simplify objects. Therefore, you can focus on the body shape, distinctive head with compound eyes and antennae, and the presence of legs.
