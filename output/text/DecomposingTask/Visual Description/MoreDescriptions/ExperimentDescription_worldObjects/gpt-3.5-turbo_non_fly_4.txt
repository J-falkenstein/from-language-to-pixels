The object I am describing to you is a fly. Its fundamental shape is that of a small, elongated oval. It has a distinct pair of wings on its sides, which are transparent and veined. The wings are positioned horizontally and extend slightly beyond the length of the body. Just behind the wings, there are two round, protruding eyes on either side of the head. The body of the fly is compact and segmented, with a visible division between the thorax and abdomen. The thorax is slightly larger than the abdomen and has three pairs of jointed legs attached to it. The legs are thin and taper towards the ends, ending in small, claw-like structures. The fly's head, which is proportional to the body, is rounded and features a pair of small antennae positioned above the eyes. Overall, the fly is a small, oval-shaped insect, with transparent wings, protruding eyes, jointed legs, and a segmented body.
