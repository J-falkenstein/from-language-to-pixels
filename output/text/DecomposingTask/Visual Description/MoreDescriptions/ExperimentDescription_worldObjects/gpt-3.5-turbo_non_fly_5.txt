The fly is a small insect with a distinctive oval shape. Its body is divided into three sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is round and houses two large compound eyes that dominate its appearance. These eyes wrap around the sides of the head and have a distinctive glossy appearance. Between the eyes, you will find a small rounded structure, the proboscis, which the fly uses to feed. 

Attached to the head are two short antennae that stick out horizontally, each having a small knob at the end. Moving down to the thorax, you will notice two pairs of wings. The wings are thin and transparent, with intricate veining patterns visible upon close inspection. These wings are aligned symmetrically and sit atop the thorax. 

The abdomen, the largest part of the fly, is elongated and tapers towards the end. It consists of several segments, which may not be clearly discernible when drawing a simplified sketch. The abdomen extends backward from the thorax, giving the fly a slightly elongated appearance. 

To summarize, when drawing a simplified sketch of a fly, focus on its oval-shaped body, distinguishable head with large compound eyes, small proboscis, and two antennae. Indicate the presence of two pairs of wings on the thorax and an elongated abdomen. Remember, these are the most important features for recognizing a fly.
