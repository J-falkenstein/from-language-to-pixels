A fly is a small insect with a distinct shape. It has a compact and slender body that is elongated horizontally. The body is divided into three parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is small and rounded, sitting at the front of the body. It has two large compound eyes that bulge out, giving the fly excellent vision. In between the eyes, there might be a small space or indentation where the antennae are located. 

The thorax is the middle part of the body, and it is slightly wider than the head and abdomen. It is usually darker in color compared to the rest of the body. On the thorax, there are two pairs of wings attached. The wings are transparent and delicate, extending slightly beyond the length of the abdomen when at rest. When unfolded, the wings might appear veiny or with faint patterns.

The abdomen is the longest part of the body and tapers towards the end. It is usually lighter in color and often has segments or distinct patterns. The abdomen might have short hairs or bristles on its surface.

Overall, the fly has a streamlined and agile appearance with its small, rounded head, slender body, and delicate wings. Focus on these essential features to simplify the sketch.
