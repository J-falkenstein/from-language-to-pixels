A fly is a small insect commonly found around humans. Its body shape is elongated and slender, resembling a small tube or cylinder. The most distinctive feature of a fly is its transparent wings, which are larger than its body and positioned in a horizontal position when at rest. The wings have a delicate, veiny texture. 

The head of a fly is relatively large compared to its body, and it is easily recognizable by its compound eyes, which are located on each side of the head. These eyes consist of numerous small hexagonal lenses, giving the fly a distinctive appearance. The eyes are usually dark in color, reflecting light in a specific way.

At the front of the fly's head, there are two short, antennae-like structures called antennae. These antennae are small and segmented, extending forward from the head. 

The fly's body is divided into three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax, which is the middle section, is relatively large and contains the muscles that power the wings. It is covered in a dark exoskeleton with a slight shine to it. The abdomen, at the rear of the fly, is slimmer and tapers towards the end.

In terms of proportions, the fly's head is larger compared to its thorax and abdomen. The wings extend past the length of the body when at rest. The overall length of a fly can vary, but it is usually around a few centimeters.

To summarize, a fly can be simplified as having an elongated cylindrical body with transparent wings, a large head with compound eyes, and short antennae. The body is divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen.
