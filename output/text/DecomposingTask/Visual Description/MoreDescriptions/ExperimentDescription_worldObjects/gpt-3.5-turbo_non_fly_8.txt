A fly is a small, winged insect with a slender, oval-shaped body. The body is divided into three distinct sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is round and has two large compound eyes that cover most of its surface. Between the eyes, there's a short, stubby pair of antennae. The thorax is where the wings and legs are attached. It is slightly elongated and narrower than the abdomen. At the front of the thorax, you can see six thin legs which are used for walking and gripping surfaces. The abdomen is elongated and tapers towards the end, giving it a more slender appearance compared to the rest of the body. On the tip of the abdomen, there may be a small stinger or a distinct pattern depending on the type of fly. The wings of a fly are transparent and veined, providing them the ability to fly and maneuver quickly. When at rest, the wings lie flat along the top of the body. Overall, a fly has a compact, streamlined shape with distinct body segments and prominent compound eyes, making it recognizable even without fine details.
