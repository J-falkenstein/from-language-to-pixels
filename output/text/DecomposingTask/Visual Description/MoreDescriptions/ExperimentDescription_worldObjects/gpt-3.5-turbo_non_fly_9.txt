A fly is a small insect with a cylindrical body and six legs. Its body is usually around 1/4 to 1/2 inch long and has a shiny appearance. The fly has a distinctive head that is slightly larger than its body, with two large compound eyes that cover most of the head's surface. Between its eyes, there's a pair of short antennae. 

The fly's wings are transparent and have a delicate, veined structure. They are longer than its body and are positioned horizontally when at rest. The wings are the most recognizable feature of a fly, as they move rapidly when the insect is flying.

At the back of the fly's body, you'll find a pair of small halteres, which are modified hindwings that help with balance during flight. These halteres are often darker in color compared to the rest of the body.

Overall, a fly's shape can be described as elongated with a distinct head, prominent compound eyes, transparent wings, and six thin legs. Remember, the key is to focus on the most important features that define the object, allowing a blind person to create a simplified sketch.
