The heart is a recognizable symbol often depicted in a simplified form. To help you sketch it, imagine a seed shape, similar to a pear, but with the narrow end facing downward. The top part of the heart, called the apex, is rounded and slightly elongated, while the bottom part, known as the base, is wider and flatter. 

The heart's distinctive feature is the central cleft or groove that separates the two lobes, giving it a two-part appearance. Starting from the apex, draw a gentle curve that slopes towards the bottom, about two-thirds of the way down. Then, curve it upwards on each side to create the rounded lobes. These lobes should be approximately equal in size and symmetrical.

Remember to keep the proportions in mind, as the top rounded part should be smaller than the wider bottom part. Additionally, the lobes should be aligned horizontally, with a slight inclination towards the left side. This inclination gives the heart its characteristic look.

Keep in mind that this description provides the simplified form of a heart. If you wish to add more details or embellishments, feel free to explore various styles or personalize it to your liking.
