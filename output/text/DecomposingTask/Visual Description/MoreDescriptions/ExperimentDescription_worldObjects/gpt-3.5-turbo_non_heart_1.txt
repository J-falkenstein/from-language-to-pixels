The heart is a symbol of love and affection. It is typically drawn as a stylized shape resembling the bottom half of an elongated pear or the rounded top of an upside-down triangle. The top of the heart is curved, forming two rounded lobes, while the bottom tapers down into a single point.

To further describe the heart, imagine drawing a horizontal line in the center of your paper. The top curve of the heart should align with this line, creating two equal-sized lobes on either side. The bottom point should touch the same line, extending slightly below it.

The distinctive feature of the heart is its symmetry. Both lobes should be similar in size and shape, forming a balanced image. The curved top edges of the lobes should smoothly connect to the point at the bottom, creating a harmonious flow.

Remember, details like veins or arteries are not necessary for a simplified sketch. Focus on capturing the overall shape and symmetry of the heart, ensuring that the lobes are equal and balanced.
