The heart is a symbol of love and emotion. It is typically depicted as a stylized shape, resembling an upside-down triangle with a rounded bottom. The fundamental shape of a heart is often described as two curved lines meeting at a point with a small dip in the center.

To further simplify, imagine drawing two symmetrical raindrop shapes that overlap slightly at their narrow ends. The top curves of the raindrop shapes connect to form the rounded top of the heart, while the bottom curves extend downward, meeting at a point to create the tip of the heart.

Distinctive features of a heart include its rounded top, curved sides, and pointed tip. The rounded top of the heart is often described as being similar to the top of an arch. The curved sides are gentle and flow smoothly into the tip. The pointed tip at the bottom is where the two sides of the heart meet.

To capture the proportions of a heart, the rounded top occupies a larger space compared to the tip. The sides of the heart curve inward slightly before extending down to meet at the point, creating a visually balanced shape.

It is important to note that when drawing, the heart can vary in style and details depending on personal preference or artistic interpretation. However, the simplified description provided here should allow someone to create a recognizable sketch of a heart.
