The heart is a symbol of love and affection. It has a simple and recognizable shape: two rounded lobes at the top, connected by a pointy bottom. Imagine it as an upside-down triangle with rounded edges. 

The top part of the heart has a slight dip in the middle, giving it a distinct "V" shape. The lobes on either side of the dip are rounded and symmetrical. The bottom of the heart tapers down to a point, like the tip of an arrow. 

The proportions of the heart are important. The top part is slightly wider than the bottom, but not excessively so. It's a gentle curve that tapers down smoothly. The overall size of the heart can vary, but it's often depicted as about the size of a clenched fist.

When drawing the heart, it's crucial to ensure that the lobes are balanced and uniform in size. The dip in the middle should be centered and not too deep. The point at the bottom should be sharp but not exaggerated. 

Remember to describe the shape, proportions, and unique features of the heart, allowing the blind person to envision its essential elements and create a simplified sketch.
