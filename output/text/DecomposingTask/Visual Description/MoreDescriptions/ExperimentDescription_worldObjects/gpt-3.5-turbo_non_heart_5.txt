The heart is a symbol of love and emotion, often depicted as a stylized shape. It is typically drawn as an inverted triangle with curved sides. The top of the heart is narrower and comes to a point, while the bottom is wider and rounded. The sides then curve inward to create a distinctive "waist" in the middle of the shape. 

Imagine a simple, symmetrical shape resembling two rounded teardrops joined together at their pointed ends. The upper part of the heart begins with a gentle curve, gradually narrowing to a point. From there, the sides smoothly curve outward, creating a graceful arc that widens towards the bottom. The bottom is rounded and slightly flattened.

To help with proportions, envision the height of the heart being approximately twice as long as the width at its widest point. The top portion, from the point to the start of the curve, should occupy about one-third of the overall height, while the bottom curved portion should take up the remaining two-thirds. The waist, where the curves meet, is positioned slightly below the center, closer to the bottom.

Remember to communicate that the heart is an abstract representation and doesn't have any internal details or textures. Focus on conveying the overall shape, curves, and proportions, as these are the most important features for the blind person to understand and sketch the heart accurately.
