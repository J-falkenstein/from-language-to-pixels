The object I want to describe to you is a heart. A heart is a symbol that represents love and affection. It has a distinct shape that resembles an upside-down teardrop or a stylized drawing of a heart. The top part of the heart is round and curves down to a point at the bottom. The sides of the heart curve inward, creating a pronounced dip or crevice in the center which is often referred to as the "valentine's dent." This dip divides the heart into two lobes, one on the left and one on the right. The lobes are relatively symmetrical, with an equal size and shape. 

To draw a simplified sketch of a heart, start by drawing the top rounded part, like a semi-circle. Then, bring the lines down on each side, curving inward to meet at the bottom point. Remember to exaggerate the curve at the bottom to create the dip or valentine's dent. Keep the lobes balanced, so they are about the same width and height. The proportions of the heart can vary, but it is generally taller than it is wide. It's important to capture the overall shape and the distinctive dip in the center to make it recognizable as a heart.
