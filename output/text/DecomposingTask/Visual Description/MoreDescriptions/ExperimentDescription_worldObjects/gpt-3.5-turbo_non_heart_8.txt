The heart is a symmetrical and elongated shape, resembling an inverted triangle with rounded edges. Its fundamental shape can be described as a curved, bulging lower portion that tapers towards a pointed top. The distinctive features of a heart include its dual lobes, which extend outward from the central point with gentle curves. These lobes give it the familiar "S" shape, like two teardrops connected at their narrow ends. 

To visualize proportions, the top of the heart can be described as approximately one-third of its overall height, while the lobes extend to form the remaining two-thirds. The lobes are roughly equal in size and align parallel to each other. The point where the lobes meet is slightly indented, creating a prominent central crease.

When drawing a heart, it's important to note that the bottom of the heart should be slightly wider than the top, giving it a more balanced appearance. The sides of the lobes should be smooth and flowing, without any sharp angles.

Overall, the heart shape is instantly recognizable due to its distinct curves, pointed top, and dual lobes. By emphasizing these fundamental features, a blind person can create a simplified sketch that captures the essence of a heart.
