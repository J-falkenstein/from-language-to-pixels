The object I am describing is a heart. The shape of the heart is like an inverted triangle with rounded edges. The top of the heart is narrower and tapers down to a rounded point at the bottom. It is symmetrical, with two curves on the sides that bulge out and then curve back in towards the center.

The heart has a distinct groove or line that runs vertically down the center, dividing it into two equal halves. The top part of the heart is slightly wider than the bottom part. The upper curves on the sides are slightly bigger and rounder than the lower ones, giving it a balanced appearance.

The heart is positioned upright, with the point at the bottom and the wider part at the top. The overall proportions are such that the top half takes up about two-thirds of the total height, while the bottom half occupies the remaining one-third.

When drawing the heart, it is important to capture its distinct shape and symmetrical curves. Focus on conveying the triangular shape with rounded edges, the vertical line in the center, and the size difference between the upper and lower curves.
