objects to a blind person:

1. Apple: Imagine a small, round object. It feels smooth to touch and fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. The top and bottom have slightly flattened areas, while the sides curve gently towards the center. Towards the top, you can feel a small, indented circular area called the stem cavity. In the middle of this indentation, there might be a small protrusion, which represents the stem. The overall shape is like a sphere with flattened regions at the top and bottom.

2. Cup: Picture a cylindrical object with a rounded bottom and a flat, circular top. It feels sturdy and is open at the top to hold liquids. The sides of the cup are vertical and smoothly curved. Towards the top, you'll find a small, semi-circular handle that sticks out from one side. The handle allows you to hold the cup comfortably. The proportions are such that the height is greater than the diameter, giving it a slightly elongated appearance.

3. Chair: Envision a four-legged structure that you can sit on. The seat is at the top and feels solid and flat. The backrest is connected to the seat and stands vertically, providing support for your back. The legs extend downwards from the seat at regular intervals, forming a stable base. The legs are perpendicular to the seat and are evenly spaced apart. The chair's shape can be described as a combination of rectangular and vertical elements.

4. Clock: Imagine a circular object hanging on the wall. The clock has two hands, one shorter and one longer, extending from the center towards the outer edge. These hands move continuously to indicate the time. The numbers 1 to 12 are present around the circumference of the circle, allowing you to tell the time based on their positions. The clock's shape is circular with the hands centrally aligned.

5. Book: Picture a rectangular object with a spine in the middle. The spine runs vertically and connects the front and back cover of the book. The front cover is located to the right of the spine and opens towards the left, allowing you to access the pages inside. The book feels slightly thicker towards the spine, thinning out towards the covers. The shape is predominantly rectangular with a vertical spine dividing the front and back covers.
