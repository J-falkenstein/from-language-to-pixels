objects.
1. Apple: A round fruit with a slightly flattened top and bottom. It has a smooth and shiny skin that can be red, green, or yellow. The stem is thin and sticks out from the top of the fruit. On the bottom, there may be a small dent or a small pointy section.

2. Chair: A four-legged object used for sitting. It consists of a flat surface supported by a rectangular or circular frame. The backrest is attached to the surface and leans backward at an angle. The legs are evenly spaced and usually straight, with a slight angle outward.

3. Car: A four-wheeled vehicle with a body that is longer than it is tall. The front section contains a large windshield, headlights, and a grille. The body extends backward with two side doors and windows. At the back, there are taillights and a trunk or cargo area.

4. Book: A rectangular object made of bound pages. It has a flat front cover and a slightly thicker spine in the middle. The back cover is also flat. The pages are aligned with the spine and can be flipped open. On the front cover, there may be a title or an image.

5. Clock: A circular object with numbers or marks around the edge representing hours and minutes. The hands (usually two or three) move on the face to indicate the time. The longer hand points to the minutes, while the shorter hand points to the hours. The clock may have a circular frame or be embedded in a larger object.

6. Tree: A tall, vertical structure with a wide base that tapers towards the top. It has a thick, solid trunk that branches out into smaller and thinner branches. The branches generally spread out in various directions, forming a canopy of leaves at the top. Some trees may also have noticeable roots spreading out from the base.

7. Cup: A cylindrical object with a circular base and an open top. It has a handle attached to the side for holding. The body of the cup is smooth and may have patterns or designs. The top rim is curved inward, and the height is shorter than the width.

Remember, the key is to focus on the essential features that distinguish each object, allowing the blind person to create a simplified sketch for recognition.
