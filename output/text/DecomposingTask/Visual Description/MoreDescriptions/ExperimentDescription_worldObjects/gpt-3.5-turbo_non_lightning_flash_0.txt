A lightning flash is a jagged, zigzag line that appears in the sky during a thunderstorm. It is known for its sharp and sudden appearance. Imagine a thick, vertical line that starts from the top and extends downwards. This line consists of irregular, angular branches that shoot out in different directions. The branches are not symmetrical; instead, they are random and asymmetrical, resembling multiple connected spikes or forks. The overall shape of the lightning flash is reminiscent of an upside-down tree with lightning shooting out from its branches. The branches do not follow a specific pattern but instead create a chaotic and energetic presence. The length and width of the flash can vary, with some being shorter and narrower, while others are longer and wider. The placement of the flash is typically seen against a dark background, emphasizing its bright and dazzling appearance.
