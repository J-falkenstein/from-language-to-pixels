A lightning flash can be described as a jagged, zigzag line that stretches across the sky. It has a distinct shape resembling a bolt or a forked tree branch. The top part of the lightning bolt is narrower and tapers off into a point, while the bottom part widens slightly. The edges of the bolt are irregular and uneven, with sharp angles and sharp points randomly scattered along its length. The length of the bolt can vary, but it is usually long and extends diagonally or vertically from the sky to the ground. The bolt often appears white or bluish-white, and it may be accompanied by flashes of light or sparks. Overall, the lightning flash has a dynamic and electrifying appearance, capturing the essence of its intense and powerful nature.
