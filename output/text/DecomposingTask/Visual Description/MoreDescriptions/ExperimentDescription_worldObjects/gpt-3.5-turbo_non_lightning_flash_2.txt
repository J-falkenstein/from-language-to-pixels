A lightning flash is a jagged, zigzag line that appears in the sky during a thunderstorm. It stretches across the sky in a diagonal or vertical direction, resembling a bolt. The main shape of a lightning flash is that of a thin, elongated strip with irregular and sharp edges. It emanates from a central point and branches out into smaller bolts as it extends outward. The central point is typically thicker and more intense than the branches. The intensity of the lightning flash is often depicted with bold lines or shading. Although there are variations, the fundamental shape of most lightning flashes can be represented by a bolt-like line with branches.
