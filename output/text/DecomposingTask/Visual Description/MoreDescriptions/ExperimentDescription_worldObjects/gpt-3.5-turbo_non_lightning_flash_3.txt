A lightning flash is a jagged, electrifying line that illuminates the dark sky. It typically appears as a zigzag shape, resembling a series of jagged, diagonal lines connected together. The overall shape can vary in length and thickness, but the essential characteristic is its non-linear, irregular pattern.

The distinctive feature of a lightning flash is its abrupt and sharp angles that create a sense of intensity and movement. These angles are not uniform, as they can point in various directions, giving the lightning its dynamic appearance. The angles can extend diagonally, horizontally, or even vertically, depending on the specific bolt.

In terms of proportions, the length of a lightning flash can range from short, compact bolts to long, stretching ones that span across the sky. And while the thickness of the bolt can differ, it is generally thinner compared to its length.

When considering spatial relationships, a lightning flash often appears against a dark backdrop, contrasting its bright and white or yellowish color. It can originate from the upper parts of storm clouds and strike down towards the ground or other objects.

To simplify the sketch of a lightning flash, you can focus on capturing the zigzag shape with its jagged angles, indicating the path and direction of the bolt. Remember to emphasize the rough, irregular nature of the lightning by avoiding smooth, straight lines.
