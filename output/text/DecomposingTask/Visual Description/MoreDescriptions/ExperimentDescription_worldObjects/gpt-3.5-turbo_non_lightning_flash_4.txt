A lightning flash is a jagged, zigzag line that stretches across the sky. It is composed of multiple branches that resemble jagged bolts of electricity. The main shape of a lightning flash is like a vertical line with smaller lines extending from it in diagonal and curving patterns. The branches of the lightning flash do not follow a straight path but rather curve and fork in various directions. The branches can be short or long, and some may even connect with other branches, forming a complex network. The overall appearance is that of a chaotic, electric burst in the sky.
