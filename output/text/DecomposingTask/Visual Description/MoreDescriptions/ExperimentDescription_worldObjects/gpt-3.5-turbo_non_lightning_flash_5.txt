A lightning flash is a jagged line that forms a crooked "Z" shape. The top part of the lightning bolt starts with a short horizontal line, slightly slanted upwards to the right. Then, it abruptly angles downwards diagonally to the left, forming a long vertical line. The bottom part of the lightning bolt starts from the bottom end of the long vertical line and points diagonally upwards to the right, crossing over the top line, and connecting to it. The entire lightning flash has an irregular and sharp zigzag pattern, resembling a bolt of electricity in the sky. It is important to note that the lightning flash does not have any distinct proportions or specific alignments with other elements; it is typically seen alone or branching out from a cloud.
