A lightning flash is a jagged, zigzag shape that streaks across the sky. It typically appears as a bold, angular line that starts from a central point and branches out in different directions. The shape of a lightning flash is irregular, resembling a series of sharp, angular lines connected together. It is thinner at the branching points and gradually widens as it extends outward.

The distinctive feature of a lightning flash is its intense brightness. When drawn, you may want to emphasize this brightness by shading the lightning flash with a lighter color or using bold strokes to represent the electric energy flowing through it.

In terms of proportions, a lightning flash can vary in length, but its width remains fairly consistent throughout. The branching points of the lightning flash are important to depict, as they contribute to the jagged appearance. They are positioned irregularly along the length of the flash, often branching out at different angles.

When drawing a lightning flash, it's helpful to consider its spatial relationship with the surrounding elements. If you are drawing a sky, for example, you may want to position the lightning flash vertically, starting from the upper part of the canvas and extending downwards. Alternatively, if you are drawing a scene where the lightning flash is striking an object, you can show its spatial relationship by positioning it to appear as if it is coming from above and impacting the object.

Remember: the key to drawing a simplified sketch of a lightning flash for a blind person is to capture its distinctive jagged shape, emphasize its brightness, and consider its spatial relationship with other elements.
