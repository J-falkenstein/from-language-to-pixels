A lightning flash is a jagged, sharp-shaped line that appears in the sky during a thunderstorm. It resembles a zigzag or a series of interconnected angles. Its main feature is its electric intensity, giving it a vibrant and dynamic appearance. The length of a lightning flash varies, but it can extend across the sky, resembling a sudden burst of energy. It often appears in a vertical or diagonal direction, creating a sense of movement from top to bottom or side to side. The width of the lightning flash can be broader at its lower ends, tapering towards the tip like a pointed arrowhead. The jagged edges of the flash form irregular angles, which snap and connect, giving it a distinct appearance. The lightning flash is commonly associated with illumination, and its visual characteristics evoke power, impact, and rapid movement.
