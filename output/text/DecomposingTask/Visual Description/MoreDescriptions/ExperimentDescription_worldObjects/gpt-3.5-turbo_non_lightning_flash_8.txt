A lightning flash is a jagged, electric discharge that occurs during a thunderstorm. It is a dramatic and powerful natural phenomenon. To describe it so a blind person can create a simplified sketch, I would focus on its distinctive features and shape.

The overall shape of a lightning flash is often described as resembling a zigzag or a forked path. Starting from a central point, it branches out into multiple jagged lines that extend in various directions. These lines can be irregularly shaped and uneven in length.

The main characteristic of a lightning flash is its sharp and pointed tips, which are the endpoints of each branching line. These tips are often slightly curved or angled and can appear to be reaching out in different directions.

To convey the spatial relationships, it's important to describe that the branching lines originate from a central point and radiate outward, covering a wide area. The lines can intersect and connect with each other, creating a complex network of paths.

It would also be helpful to mention the alignment of the lightning flash with other elements. For example, you could describe how it usually appears in the sky, cutting through dark clouds or illuminating the night sky. Additionally, you could mention its dynamic nature, as it often appears in a quick and fleeting manner.

Overall, an effective description of a lightning flash would emphasize its jagged and forked shape, the sharp and pointed tips of its branching lines, its wide coverage, and its dynamic presence in the sky.
