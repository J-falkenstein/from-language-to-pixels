A lightning flash can be described as a jagged, zigzag line that stretches across the sky. It is typically thin and tapers towards the ends. The main feature of a lightning flash is its branching structure. The line starts at a central point and splits into several smaller branches that spread out in different directions. These branches can be irregular and vary in length. The shape of a lightning flash is often described as resembling a fork or the letter "Y." It is important to note that a lightning flash is typically brighter in the middle and becomes fainter towards the edges, giving it a slightly tapered appearance. The length and proportion of a lightning flash can vary greatly, so it is important to focus on the overall shape and branching structure when attempting to draw it.
