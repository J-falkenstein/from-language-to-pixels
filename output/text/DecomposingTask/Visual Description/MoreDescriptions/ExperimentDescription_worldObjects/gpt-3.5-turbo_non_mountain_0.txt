A mountain is a massive elevated natural structure that rises high above the surrounding land. It has a triangular shape, with a wide base gradually tapering to a pointed peak. The base of the mountain is broader and wider, while the upper portion becomes steeper and narrower. The peak often has a jagged and uneven outline.

Mountains are characterized by their tall and grand stature, towering over the surrounding landscape. They are made up of various layers of rocks and often display different shades of gray, brown, or green, depending on the vegetation coverage. 

Looking from a distance, a mountain appears as a dominant feature in the scenery, with its peak reaching towards the sky. It creates a striking contrast against the horizon and can be seen from miles away. The size of a mountain can vary greatly, ranging from small hills to majestic ranges stretching across vast distances.

When examining a mountain closely, one can notice the rugged texture of its surface, which is often covered in trees, vegetation, or snow. The slopes of a mountain can exhibit different angles and inclinations, providing a sense of depth. The shadows cast by the mountain's peak and slopes also contribute to its visual characteristics, emphasizing the rough and uneven terrain.

Overall, the key elements to describe a mountain to a blind person would be its triangular shape, towering height, jagged peak, and the contrast it creates against the surrounding landscape.
