A mountain is a large, natural landform that rises high above the surrounding areas. Its shape is often described as a triangular or conical peak, reaching up towards the sky. The base of the mountain is wider and broader, gradually narrowing as it approaches the top. The peak may be pointed or rounded, depending on the type of mountain.

Some distinctive features of a mountain include steep slopes or cliffs on its sides, which may be rough and jagged. These slopes can create a sense of ruggedness and height. As you move up the mountain, you may notice changes in vegetation and climate, with forests giving way to barren rocky regions at higher altitudes. Snow-capped peaks are also common, especially in colder regions.

Proportions and alignments can vary depending on the specific mountain. However, it is important to note that mountains are usually taller than their surroundings, creating a sense of dominance and elevation. They may also form part of mountain ranges or be isolated peaks.

When drawing a simplified sketch of a mountain, focus on the basic triangular shape with a wider base and narrower peak. Use lines to indicate the slopes and cliffs, and consider adding a distinctive snow-capped peak if applicable. Remember to convey a sense of height and dominance in your sketch.
