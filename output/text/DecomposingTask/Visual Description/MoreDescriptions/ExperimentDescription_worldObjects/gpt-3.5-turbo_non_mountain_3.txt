A mountain is a large landform that rises high above the surrounding areas. It has a triangular or pyramidal shape, with a pointed peak at the top. The base of the mountain is broader and wider, gradually tapering towards the summit. 

One of the distinctive features of a mountain is its ruggedness, characterized by steep slopes and jagged edges. The sides of the mountain are often covered with a mix of vegetation and rocky outcrops. These rocky areas create variations in texture, providing a rough appearance.

The spatial relationship of a mountain can be described by its height and prominence in the landscape. Mountains are often found in clusters or ranges, extending across vast distances. They may be aligned in a series, forming ridges or peaks that create an undulating silhouette against the sky.

The proportions of a mountain are such that the height, as well as the width, decrease as you move from the base to the summit. The angle of the slopes varies, but they are typically steeper near the summit and gradually become gentler towards the base.

In summary, a mountain has a triangular or pyramidal shape, with a pointed peak and a broader base. It is characterized by rugged slopes, jagged edges, and a mix of vegetation and rocky areas. The spatial relationship involves its prominence in the landscape, often found in clusters or ranges. The proportions include a decrease in height and width from the base to the summit, with steeper slopes at the top and gradually gentler slopes towards the base.
