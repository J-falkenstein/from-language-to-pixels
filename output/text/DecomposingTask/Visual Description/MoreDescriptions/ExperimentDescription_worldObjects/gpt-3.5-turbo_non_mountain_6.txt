A mountain is a large landform that rises prominently above its surroundings. It has a distinct triangular shape, resembling an upside-down cone. The base of the mountain is wide and gradually narrows as it reaches the peak. The peak is pointed and can sometimes be covered with snow. 

Mountains often have rugged and uneven surfaces, with ridges and slopes extending in various directions. These slopes can be steep or gentle, depending on the mountain's location and formation. The sides of the mountain may appear jagged or rocky, with cliffs and crevices.

In terms of proportions, the height of the mountain is much greater than its width at the base. The slopes gradually increase in steepness as you ascend, leading to the narrower peak. The alignment of the slopes is such that they converge towards the top, creating a distinct triangular silhouette.

When observing a mountain, it is important to note its spatial relationship with the surrounding landscape. Mountains can be part of a range, lined up one after another, or can stand alone as solitary peaks. They may also be surrounded by forests, lakes, or other natural elements, adding to their visual impact.

Overall, the key features to focus on when drawing a simplified sketch of a mountain are its triangular shape, the gradual narrowing towards the peak, and any distinctive details such as ridges and rocky surfaces.
