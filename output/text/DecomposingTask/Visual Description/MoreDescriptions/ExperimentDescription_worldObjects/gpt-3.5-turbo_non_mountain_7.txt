A mountain is a massive structure that rises high above the surrounding land. It has a distinct triangular shape, with a broad base that gradually tapers into a peak at the top. The base of the mountain is wider compared to the peak. 

Mountains often have jagged edges or ridges along their sides, which add to their distinctive appearance. These ridges create a serrated or uneven silhouette against the sky. Additionally, mountains may have slopes or steep cliffs leading up to their peaks, creating a sense of grandeur and verticality.

Proportions-wise, the base of the mountain covers a larger area compared to its overall height. The sides of the mountain generally slope upwards at an angle, gradually becoming steeper as they approach the peak. Although mountains can vary in size and shape, their general form follows these fundamental features.

When describing the spatial relationships, you can mention that mountains often stand independently, rising above the surrounding landscape. They can be seen in isolation or form part of mountain ranges, where multiple peaks are aligned in a sequence. In some cases, smaller peaks or foothills may surround a larger mountain, creating a layered effect.

Remember, as a blind person, these descriptions should help them grasp the essential characteristics of mountains and enable them to sketch a simplified representation.
