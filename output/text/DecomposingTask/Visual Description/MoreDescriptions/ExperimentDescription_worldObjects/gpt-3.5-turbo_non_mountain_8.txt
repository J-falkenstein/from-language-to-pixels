A mountain is a majestic natural formation that rises high above the surrounding land. Its fundamental shape can be described as a triangular or pyramid-like structure, with a wide base that gradually narrows towards its peak. The distinctive feature of a mountain is its enormous size and height, often towering above the landscape.

Proportions are evident as the mountain's base is usually larger in comparison to its height, creating a sloping incline. The alignment of a mountain can vary based on its surroundings, but it typically stands tall and upright, reaching towards the sky. 

Relevant spatial relationships can be described by emphasizing how a mountain stands independently, separated from the nearby land by slopes or valleys. It is often surrounded by lower-lying areas, such as plains or hills, contributing to its prominence.

To help the blind person draw a simplified sketch of a mountain, you can guide them to draw a triangular shape, starting with a wide base and gradually narrowing it towards the top. Emphasize that the lines should be slanting upwards, indicating the slope of the mountain. Highlight that the height of the mountain should be shorter compared to the width of the base.
