A mountain is a large land formation that rises above its surroundings and has a distinctive peak or summit. It has a triangular shape, with a wide base, gradually narrowing towards the top. The base of the mountain is wider and more expansive, while the summit is pointed or rounded, depending on the type of mountain.

The most distinguishing feature of a mountain is its towering height, often appearing to touch the sky. It stands tall and majestic, reaching high into the atmosphere. Mountains are characterized by their steep slopes, which are inclined or slanting. These slopes may be smooth or rugged, depending on their location and geological composition.

Mountains can be covered in vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, or grass, depending on the altitude and climate of the region. Snow-capped peaks are also a common feature, especially in colder regions or during winter seasons.

When observing a mountain, you can notice the contrast between its sharp or jagged edges and the softer, rolling contours of the surrounding landscape. The mountain may appear solitary or be part of a larger mountain range, with other peaks extending along its sides.

As you imagine drawing a simplified sketch of a mountain, focus on capturing its triangular shape, the steep slopes, and the peak or summit. Keep in mind the importance of proportions, making sure the base is wider and the summit is narrower. The sketch should convey the grandeur and prominence of the mountain, even without intricate details.
