The object I will describe is a computer mouse. 

The fundamental shape of a computer mouse can be described as an oval or slightly elongated teardrop shape. It has a rounded top and tapers slightly towards the front. 

The most distinctive feature of a mouse is the presence of two buttons on the top. These buttons are usually located on the front half of the mouse, with the left button towards the left side and the right button towards the right side. The buttons are slightly elevated above the surface of the mouse, creating a slight curve. 

In between the two buttons, there is usually a scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is placed slightly lower than the buttons and is aligned with them in a straight line. 

Towards the back of the mouse, there is a slightly indented area which acts as a resting place for the palm of your hand. This area is wider than the front part of the mouse and provides a comfortable grip. 

The bottom of the mouse is flat and smooth, allowing it to glide easily across a surface. It often has a small red light or optical sensor near the front, which helps in tracking the movements of the mouse. 

To summarize, a computer mouse has an oval or teardrop shape with rounded top and front, two elevated buttons on top, aligned with a scroll wheel in between, a slightly indented area for the palm towards the back, and a flat and smooth bottom.
