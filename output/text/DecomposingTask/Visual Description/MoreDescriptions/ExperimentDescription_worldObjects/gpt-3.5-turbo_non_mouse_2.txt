The object I will describe is a computer mouse. It is a small, handheld device used to control the movement of a cursor on a computer screen. 

The mouse has a basic rectangular shape, with a slightly curved top surface. Its length is longer than its width, making it more elongated than square. 

On the top surface, you will find a left click button positioned towards the front left corner of the mouse, and a right click button towards the front right corner. These buttons are slightly raised and have a distinct concave shape when pressed. 

In the center of the mouse, there is a scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is a small, cylindrical object that can be rotated forward or backward. It allows you to navigate through documents or web pages vertically. 

Towards the bottom of the mouse, there is a smooth, flat surface with rubber pads. These pads allow the mouse to glide smoothly when moved across a surface, like a desk or mousepad. 

At the front of the mouse, there is a thin cable or a wireless receiver, depending on the type of mouse. This cable or receiver connects the mouse to the computer, allowing it to transmit the movements to the screen. 

To summarize, the computer mouse is a handheld device with a rectangular shape and a slightly curved top surface. It has left and right click buttons, a scroll wheel in the center, and rubber pads at the bottom. The front of the mouse is either a thin cable or a wireless receiver.
