The object is small and handheld, with a rectangular shape. It has a rounded top that curves downwards towards the front. Imagine a slightly elongated oval shape, but with a flat bottom. At the front, there is a small bump, which is the left-click button. It is situated towards the left side of the object, slightly closer to the top. In the middle of the oval, there is a shorter, wider button, which is the scroll wheel. It separates the left-click button from the right-click button, which is another small bump on the right side of the oval. The right-click button is placed closer to the bottom of the object. Overall, the object is symmetrical horizontally, with the left and right buttons aligned vertically. The object is mostly smooth, but you might feel some texture on the buttons for better grip.
