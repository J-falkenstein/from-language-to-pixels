The object I am describing is a computer mouse. 

Fundamental Shape: The computer mouse has a generally oval or slightly curved shape. It is wider towards the back and tapers down towards the front.

Distinctive Features: At the top of the mouse, you will find a slightly raised, circular area known as the "scroll wheel." It is positioned between the left and right-click buttons. The left and right-click buttons are usually rectangular or square-shaped and are located towards the front of the mouse. Towards the back of the mouse, there is a smaller button called the "back button," positioned slightly to the left side of the mouse.

Proportions and Alignments: The scroll wheel is positioned directly in the middle of the top surface of the mouse. It is equidistant from both the left and right-click buttons. The left and right-click buttons are aligned horizontally, parallel to the front edge of the mouse. The back button sits slightly to the left of the left-click button.

Relevant Spatial Relationships: When holding the mouse, the back button is within easy reach of your thumb, while the left and right-click buttons are positioned under your index and middle fingers. The scroll wheel is located right in the center of the mouse, allowing for easy scrolling with your index finger.

With these details, you should be able to create a simplified sketch of a computer mouse that accurately conveys its essential features.
