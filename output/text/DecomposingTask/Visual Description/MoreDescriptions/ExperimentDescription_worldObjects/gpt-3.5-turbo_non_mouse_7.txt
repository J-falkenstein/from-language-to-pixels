The object is a small, rectangular device called a mouse. It is primarily used to control a computer. Its fundamental shape is a slightly elongated rectangle with a rounded back. Imagine holding a small bar of soap in your hand.

At the top of the mouse, there is a round, plastic piece known as the scroll wheel. It protrudes slightly above the surface and is positioned between the left and right buttons. The scroll wheel can be rotated up or down to navigate through content on the computer screen.

Towards the front of the mouse, there are two distinct buttons placed horizontally. The left button is located on the left side, while the right button sits on the right side. They are slightly elevated above the surface and can be pressed easily with the fingers.

On the underside of the mouse, there is a small, smooth pad that allows the mouse to glide smoothly on a desktop or mousepad. A thin, optical sensor is positioned towards the front-end of the mouse, which tracks the movement of the mouse on a surface.

The mouse is proportioned in a way that the scroll wheel is aligned vertically between the two side buttons. The left button is positioned on the left side of the mouse, while the right button is on the right side. The size of the mouse typically fits comfortably in one hand.

So, in summary, the mouse is a small rectangular device with a rounded back. It has a scroll wheel between two horizontal buttons at the top, and a smooth pad underneath. Its distinctive features are the buttons, scroll wheel, and the optical sensor.
