The object I am describing is a computer mouse. It is a rectangular-shaped device with a slightly curved top surface. The length of the mouse is about twice the width. 

On the top surface, towards the front, there is a small rounded button that can be pressed with the index finger. This button is slightly elevated compared to the rest of the surface. Towards the center of the mouse, there is a scroll wheel that is positioned vertically. It is slightly raised and has small ridges for grip.

Beneath the scroll wheel, there are two distinct buttons, one on the left and one on the right side. These buttons are rectangular-shaped and can be pressed with the thumb and ring finger respectively. They are aligned horizontally.

On the backside of the mouse, there is a curved indentation where the palm of the hand rests. This area is slightly elevated compared to the rest of the mouse. Towards the front of the mouse, there is a small LED light that emits a faint glow when the mouse is in use.

Overall, the mouse has a smooth and sleek appearance. It is lightweight and fits comfortably in the hand. The main features to focus on when drawing a simplified sketch would be the rectangular shape, the curved top surface, the small elevated button towards the front, the scroll wheel and its position, and the distinct left and right buttons beneath it.
