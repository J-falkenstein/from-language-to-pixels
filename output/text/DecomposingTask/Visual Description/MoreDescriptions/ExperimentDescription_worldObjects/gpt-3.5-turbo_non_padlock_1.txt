The padlock is a small, rectangular-shaped object made of metal. Its fundamental shape resembles a box, with a slightly longer bottom portion and a shorter top portion. The distinctive features of a padlock include a U-shaped shackle that hangs down from the top portion and locks into the bottom portion. The shackle is usually made of thick metal and has a curved shape. It is attached to the padlock on one side, forming a hinge-like connection. The bottom portion of the padlock has a small keyhole, which is usually located in the center. In terms of proportions, the shackle is typically longer than the height of the padlock, extending a bit beyond its bottom edge. The keyhole is generally in line with the center of the bottom portion. Overall, the padlock can be imagined as a rectangular box with a U-shaped shackle hanging down from the top and locking into the bottom, forming its distinct shape.
