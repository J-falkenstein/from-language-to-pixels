The object I want to describe is a padlock. It has a basic shape of a rectangle with rounded corners. The most important feature is its shackle, which is the curved metal piece used to lock and secure the padlock. The shackle extends out from the narrow side of the rectangle, resembling a letter "C" turned on its side. It aligns with the upper edge of the padlock's body.

The body of the padlock is chunky and thick, giving it a sturdy appearance. The top part of the body has a small hole in the center, which is where the shackle is inserted and locked. On one side of the body, you'll find a keyhole, which is used to unlock and release the shackle. The keyhole is typically positioned closer to the wider side of the body, near the bottom.

The proportions of the padlock are such that the shackle is shorter in length compared to the overall size of the body. The shackle usually extends around a quarter or a third of the body's height, starting from the upper edge. This creates a visual imbalance, with the body appearing larger and more substantial compared to the shackle.

Overall, the padlock has a distinct shape that is easily recognizable. Its most important features include the curved shackle, the rectangular body with rounded corners, and the keyhole located near the wider side of the body.
