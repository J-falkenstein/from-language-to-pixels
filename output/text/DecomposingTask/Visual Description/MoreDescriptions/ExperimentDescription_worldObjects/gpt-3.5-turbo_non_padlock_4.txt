The object to be described is a padlock. A padlock is a small, solid, and rectangular-shaped lock used for securing belongings. Its overall shape can be likened to a compact rectangle. 

Starting from the top, there is a short, horizontal metal shackle which is used to secure the padlock. The shackle extends vertically down into the body of the padlock, resembling an uppercase "D" or a backwards "L." The body of the padlock is slightly taller than the shackle and has a rectangular shape.

The padlock has a clear distinction between its upper and lower sections. The upper section, directly above the shackle, houses the keyhole. This keyhole is a small circular opening through which a key is inserted to lock or unlock the padlock. 

Below the keyhole, the lower section of the padlock has a loop or a hole that is often used to attach the padlock to a chain, gate, or other objects. The loop is positioned horizontally at the bottom of the padlock, directly beneath the keyhole.

In terms of proportions, the shackle and body of the padlock are typically of similar width. The height of the padlock is slightly taller than its width, providing a balanced rectangular appearance.

By emphasizing these key features, such as the rectangular shape, the distinct "D" or backwards "L" shaped shackle, the circular keyhole, and the loop at the bottom, a simplified sketch of a padlock can be created, allowing the blind person to visualize its essential characteristics.
