The padlock is a small and rectangular object that consists of two main parts: a body and a shackle. The body of the padlock is a box-like shape, typically made of metal, with flat surfaces on the front and back. Its overall dimensions are usually around 2-3 inches in height and 1-2 inches in width, but these may vary. 

The body of the padlock has a keyhole located on the front surface, usually in the center or slightly towards the top. The keyhole is a small, round opening, often with a little indentation surrounding it. 

The shackle of the padlock is a curved metal piece that extends from one side of the body and loops back to connect to the opposite side. The shackle is relatively thin and cylindrical, allowing it to rotate freely within the body of the lock. It is typically longer than the width of the body, protruding on either side. 

When closed, the shackle aligns parallel to the front surface of the body, with a small gap between the shackle and the body. This gap allows the shackle to move up and down when the padlock is unlocked or locked. 

To summarize, the padlock has a rectangular body, with flat surfaces on the front and back. It has a keyhole on the front surface, typically in the center. The shackle is a curved metal piece that extends from one side of the body and loops back to the other side. When closed, the shackle aligns parallel to the front surface of the body, with a small gap between them.
