A padlock is a small, rectangular object commonly used for securing things. Its fundamental shape is rectangular, with a slightly curved top and bottom. The overall proportions are typically taller than wide.

Start by imagining a rectangle, slightly longer vertically. The top and bottom edges are slightly curved inward, giving the padlock a gentle arch. 

In the center of the rectangle, closer to the top, there is a circular keyhole. This keyhole stands out as one of the distinctive features of a padlock. It is usually positioned closer to the top edge, allowing room for a shackle or loop to attach through the bottom.

Moving downwards from the keyhole, you can visualize a short, vertical line around one-third of the total height of the rectangle. This line represents the base of the shackle or loop, which is an essential part of a padlock. The shackle is typically slightly thicker than the body of the padlock itself.

Other important details to consider are two curved lines that connect the sides of the rectangle to the top and bottom curved edges. These lines create a smooth transition between the body of the padlock and the curved top and bottom.

Overall, a padlock is a rectangular object with curved edges, a circular keyhole towards the top, and a shorter vertical line representing the shackle or loop near the bottom. Keep in mind that the proportions may vary slightly, but these basic features will help you recognize and draw a simplified sketch of a padlock.
