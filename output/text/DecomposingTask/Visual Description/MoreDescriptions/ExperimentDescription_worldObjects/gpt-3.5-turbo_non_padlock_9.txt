The padlock is a small object that is often used to secure things. It has a basic shape of a rectangular or square box. The main body of the padlock is usually made of metal and it has a sturdy and robust appearance. At the top of the padlock, there is a metal loop called a shackle, which is used to lock and unlock the padlock. The shackle is typically curved and can move freely. It is attached to the main body of the padlock through a small gap. The body of the padlock often has two distinct parts, an upper and a lower portion, which are separated by a visible line or groove. This line helps distinguish the parts visually. On the front side of the padlock, there is a keyhole, a small and round opening where a key can be inserted to unlock it. The keyhole is normally located near the top of the padlock, just above the line that separates the upper and lower parts. The keyhole itself is usually smooth and circular in shape. Overall, the padlock appears compact and symmetrical in its design, with a clear separation between the body and the shackle.
