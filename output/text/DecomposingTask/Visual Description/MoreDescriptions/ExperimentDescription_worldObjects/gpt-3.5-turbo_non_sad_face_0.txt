A sad face typically consists of a simple circular shape. The circle represents the head, with no specific proportions necessary. Towards the top center of the circle, draw a small curve pointing downwards. This curve represents the eyebrows, which are curved downwards to convey a sad expression. Below the eyebrows, draw two small circles for the eyes, positioned slightly closer to the bottom part of the circle to indicate a downward gaze. Inside each eye, draw a smaller circle towards the outer corners to represent the pupils. Moving downwards, draw a curved line to connect the eyes, representing the bridge of the nose. Towards the lower center of the circle, draw a small curve pointing upwards to form a straightforward line for the mouth. This line should curve downward slightly at each end to create the appearance of a frown. The nose and mouth should not have specific proportions, just a general placement. Lastly, if desired, you can add teardrops on either side of the face to further enhance the representation of sadness. Remember, the key is to keep it simple and focus on the essential features to recognize a sad face.
