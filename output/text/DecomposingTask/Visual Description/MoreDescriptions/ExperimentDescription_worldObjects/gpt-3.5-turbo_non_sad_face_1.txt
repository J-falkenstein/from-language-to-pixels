A sad face can be recognized by its downward curving shape and droopy features. Imagine a simple circular shape, slightly elongated vertically to mimic a face. The eyes would be represented by two small oval shapes placed near the top third of the face, slightly slanted downwards towards the center. These ovals would give the impression of droopy or tired eyes. 

Below the eyes, draw a gently curving line to represent the downturned eyebrows. These eyebrows would be closer to the center of the face, creating a sad, frowning expression. 

Finally, draw a small, curved line similar to a mouth positioned at the bottom portion of the face. This curved line would be slightly tilted upwards on the ends, as if attempting a slight smile despite the sadness. 

Remember to keep the lines simple and smooth, avoiding sharp angles or jagged edges. This basic sketch should capture the essence of a sad face.
