The object is a sad face. It consists of two tilted oval shapes, one bigger and one smaller, positioned vertically. The bigger oval shape is positioned above the smaller one. The smaller oval shape is placed towards the bottom of the bigger oval shape, slightly off-center. The ovals represent the eyes of the sad face. 

Underneath the two oval shapes, there is a curved line that represents a frown. The line starts at one end of the bigger oval shape and curves downward, parallel to the smaller oval shape. The frown line connects both sides of the bigger oval shape. It is important to ensure the line is curved downward to give the impression of sadness.
