To describe the visual characteristics of a sad face to a blind person, I would focus on the shape and key elements that are essential in recognizing this facial expression. Here is a simplified description:

A sad face can be represented by a downward curve shape. Imagine a slightly elongated oval tilted horizontally. At the top center of this oval, there are two small circles representing eyes. These circles should be placed closer to the top edge of the oval, and their position should align horizontally with each other. The eyes are downward-facing, reflecting sadness.

Below the eyes, slightly towards the bottom center of the oval, there is a curved line that represents a frowning mouth. This line curves downwards in the shape of an upside-down letter "U". It should be placed centrally below the eyes, aligning horizontally with them.

Remember that the main focus of this description is to convey the sadness of the face rather than intricate details.
