A sad face can be represented by a simple downward curve shape. Imagine a small, elongated oval that is slightly tilted to the side, like a frown. This oval represents the overall shape of the face. 

At the top of the oval, about one-third from the left side, draw a small circle to represent the left eye. The right eye can be drawn in the same manner, but placed about two-thirds from the left side of the oval. These circles should be small and close to each other, indicating sadness.

Now, imagine a small curve below the eyes to represent the downturned mouth. This curve starts from the left side of the oval, goes downwards slightly in the middle, and ends on the right side of the oval. It should mimic a frown, emphasizing the feeling of sadness.

That's it! By following these descriptions, you should be able to sketch a simplified representation of a sad face. Remember, the most important features are the downward curve shape for the face, the small circles representing the eyes, and the downturned curve representing the mouth.
