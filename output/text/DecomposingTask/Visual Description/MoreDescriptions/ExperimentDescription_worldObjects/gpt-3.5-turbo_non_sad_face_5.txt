A sad face can be described as a simple circle, tilted slightly to one side. The circle represents the head of the face. Within the circle, there are two small, downward-slanting lines that start at the top of the circle and extend towards the bottom. These lines form the eyes, which appear droopy and downcast. Just below the eyes, there is a short, curved line that forms the mouth, which is turned downwards in a frown. The mouth line starts from one side of the circle and curves downward towards the other side, emphasizing the sadness. Overall, the face has a downward orientation, conveying a somber expression.
