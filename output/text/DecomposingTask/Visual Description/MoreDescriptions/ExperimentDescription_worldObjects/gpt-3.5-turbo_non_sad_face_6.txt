A sad face is a circular shape with a slightly elongated appearance. The top part of the circle represents the forehead, while the bottom part indicates the chin. The most noticeable feature of a sad face is the downward curve of the mouth, which gives it a frowning expression. The mouth can be positioned in the center of the face or slightly towards the bottom. The eyes are usually two small circular shapes placed above the mouth. They are usually positioned closer to the top part of the face, conveying a sense of sadness and melancholy. The eyebrows can be depicted with a slight curve downwards, further emphasizing the sad expression.
