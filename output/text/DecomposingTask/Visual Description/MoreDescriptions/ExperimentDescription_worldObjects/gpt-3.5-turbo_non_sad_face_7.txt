A sad face is typically represented by a downward curve. Imagine a simple circle shape, slightly elongated vertically. The eyes, usually represented by two small circles, are positioned towards the top part of the circle, closer to the horizontal center. These eyes are most commonly positioned a little closer to the sides of the circle rather than directly in the middle. 

Below the eyes, draw a slightly curved line to represent the downturned mouth. This line starts slightly above the horizontal center of the circle and ends just below it, forming a sad expression. 

Remember, the key elements to focus on for a sad face are the elongated circle shape, the position of the eyes towards the top of the circle, and the curved line for the mouth that conveys a downward curve.
