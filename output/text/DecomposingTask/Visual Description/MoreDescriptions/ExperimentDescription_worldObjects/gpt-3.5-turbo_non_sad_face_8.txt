A sad face is typically represented by an upside-down U-shaped mouth, curved downwards to depict a frown. The mouth is located in the center of the face and is often accompanied by slightly droopy or downturned eyebrows above. The eyebrows can be described as two curved lines that slant downwards towards the inner corners of the eyes. The eyes themselves are usually depicted as two small circles or ovals, positioned above the mouth, with no specific alignment required. The rest of the face can be left blank or simply represented by a plain circle, as the key features for recognizing a sad face lie predominantly in the mouth and eyebrows.
