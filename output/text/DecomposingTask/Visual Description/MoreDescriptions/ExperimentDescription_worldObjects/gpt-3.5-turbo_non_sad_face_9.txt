A sad face is a simple yet recognizable facial expression that conveys sadness or unhappiness. Let's break down the visual description:

- Shape: The shape of a sad face can be represented by a downward-curving arc or semi-circle, resembling a frown. It starts at the top center, curves downward, and then slightly curves upward at the ends.

- Distinctive features: The most crucial element is the downturned curved line that acts as the mouth. It typically starts in the middle just below the center point of the face shape and extends outwards to create a frown. This curved line is the primary indicator of sadness. Sometimes, two short lines or dots may be added towards the outer ends of the mouth curve to represent downturned corners of the lips.

- Proportions: The mouth, formed by the downward arc, usually occupies the lower portion of the face shape. The distance between the top of the face shape and the lowest point of the mouth indicates the size of the eyes, nose, and forehead above it. However, for simplicity, proportions can be disregarded in this basic description.

- Alignments and spatial relationships: The downturned curve of the mouth is aligned horizontally across the center of the face shape, creating a symmetry. The endpoints of the curve should be relatively aligned to maintain the natural appearance of the frown.

Remember that this description aims to provide the most essential visual characteristics for a simplified sketch of a sad face.
