The skull is a rounded, bony structure that forms the framework of the head. It has a somewhat oval shape, with a flat back and a pointed front. The top of the skull is slightly curved, creating a smooth surface.

At the front of the skull, there is a prominent feature called the forehead, which protrudes slightly forward. Moving down towards the middle of the skull, you'll notice two hollow eye sockets, positioned symmetrically on either side. They are usually oval-shaped and slightly sunken in, giving the skull a distinct appearance.

Below the eye sockets, there is a small, triangular-shaped nose cavity, positioned centrally. Just beneath the nose cavity, you'll find a horizontal slit-like opening called the mouth. It is relatively smaller compared to the eye sockets.

Moving towards the back of the skull, you may notice two rounded, bumpy protrusions on either side, known as the temples. These are positioned slightly above and behind the eye sockets. Further down, you'll find a larger hole called the eye socket, positioned behind each eye socket. These holes are where the ears would usually be located.

The various features of the skull align in a way that creates a balanced, symmetrical structure. The eye sockets, nose cavity, and mouth are positioned in a straight line, following the centerline of the skull. The temples are aligned with the top of the eye sockets.

Overall, the skull has a compact, rigid appearance, with its distinct features allowing for easy recognition.
