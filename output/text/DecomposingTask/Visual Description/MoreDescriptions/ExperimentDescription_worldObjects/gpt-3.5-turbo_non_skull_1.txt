A skull is a bone structure that forms the framework of the head in humans and animals. It has a distinct shape, resembling a rounded oval or an egg. The top part of the skull, known as the cranium, is a smooth and curved surface that encloses and protects the brain. 

At the front of the skull, there is a bony structure called the forehead, which protrudes slightly. Moving downward, you will notice two large eye sockets, which are symmetrical and hollow. These sockets are positioned in the front and center of the skull, slightly above the halfway point. 

Beneath the eye sockets, there is a nasal cavity, forming the bridge of the nose. The nasal cavity is usually narrow and connects to two small openings, called nostrils. These nostrils are located towards the lower part of the face, slightly below the midline of the skull. 

On either side of the skull, towards the back, you will observe two rounded shapes known as the temporal bones. They are positioned symmetrically and slightly towards the lower part of the skull. These temporal bones have small openings, known as ear canals, where the ears are situated. 

Overall, the skull has a balanced and symmetrical appearance. Its main features include the rounded cranium, the protruding forehead, the large eye sockets, the nasal cavity extending from the bridge of the nose, and the temporal bones towards the back of the skull. These features, when combined, create the recognizable shape of a skull.
