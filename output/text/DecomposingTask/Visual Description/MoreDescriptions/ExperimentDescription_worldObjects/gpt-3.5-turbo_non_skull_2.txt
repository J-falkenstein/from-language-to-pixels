The object I will be describing is a skull. The skull has a round, oval-shaped structure. It is empty in the center and lacks a lower jaw. 

Starting from the top, you will notice a slightly curved, smooth surface that feels like a dome shape. This represents the top of the skull, known as the cranium. Moving towards the front, the cranium gradually slopes forward and downwards, forming a rounded shape for the forehead.

On the front of the skull, you will find two large openings, one on each side. These are the eye sockets. Above the eye sockets, there are two bony ridges that slightly protrude forward. These ridges are commonly referred to as the eyebrows. They give the skull a distinct feature.

Continuing down, you will find a small triangular-shaped space in the center of the forehead, just above the eye sockets. This is where the nose would be located. Although the nose is not present, this area can be felt as a slightly concave indentation.

Moving towards the bottom part of the skull, there is a horizontal opening right below the eye sockets. This is where the nasal cavity would be located. It appears like two small holes side by side. 

Directly below the nasal cavity, you will encounter a narrow, elongated opening in the center. This is the space where the mouth would be, but as mentioned earlier, the lower jaw is missing. 

Overall, the skull has a symmetrical and somewhat round shape. The forehead slopes forward, the eye sockets are located on either side, and there are distinct ridges above them. The nasal cavity is just below the eye sockets, with a small triangular space representing the nose in the center. The absence of the lower jaw can be observed as a gap below the nasal cavity.
