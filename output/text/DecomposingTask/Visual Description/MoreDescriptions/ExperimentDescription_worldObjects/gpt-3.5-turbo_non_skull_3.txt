The object I am describing is a skull. Its overall shape is a rounded structure, resembling an upside-down "U." The skull is symmetrical, with a smooth and curved top surface that gradually slopes downward towards the front.

Starting from the top, there are two prominent eye sockets, hollowed-out areas on the front side of the skull, located symmetrically on either side of the center. These sockets have a rounded shape and are positioned slightly below the top surface.

Moving further down, there is a distinct nose hole, which is located between the eye sockets and slightly lower. It is shaped like a vertical oval and positioned centrally.

Just below the nose hole, you will find a horizontal line representing the mouth area. It stretches across the front of the skull and has a slightly curved shape upwards at each end, resembling a shallow smile.

Below the mouth, there are two sets of rounded teeth, one on the top and one on the bottom. The teeth appear as curved rows, with the upper set being smaller and positioned slightly inside the lower set.

The skull's sides taper towards the back, forming smooth and curved surfaces, which meet at the back of the skull. At the back, there is a noticeable rounded bump, called the occipital protuberance, located centrally.

Overall, the skull has a robust and solid appearance, with the eye sockets, nose hole, mouth area, and teeth being its most distinctive features. Remember, these descriptions are simplified to help you create a basic sketch, so feel free to emphasize the main shapes and features while keeping it as simple as possible.
