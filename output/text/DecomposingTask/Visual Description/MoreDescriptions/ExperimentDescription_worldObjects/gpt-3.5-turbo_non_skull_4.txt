The object I am describing is a skull. The overall shape of a skull is rounded, resembling an oval. It has two distinct eye sockets located towards the front, slightly above the middle of the skull. The eye sockets are symmetrical and concave, forming hollow areas where the eyes would be. Above the eye sockets, there is a bony ridge that extends horizontally, creating a distinct brow line. Moving upward from the middle of the skull, you will find a small, rounded indentation called the nasal cavity, which is positioned above the gap that would be the nose. The nasal cavity is also symmetrical and sits in the front center of the skull. On either side of the skull, at the back, there are two ear holes, shaped like elongated ovals. These ear holes are slightly below the middle of the skull and are positioned diagonally. To the back of the skull, there is a large, round opening called the cranial cavity, which is where the brain would be enclosed. This opening is situated towards the upper part of the skull and may not be visible from all angles. These are the essential features of a skull that will help you create a simplified sketch.
