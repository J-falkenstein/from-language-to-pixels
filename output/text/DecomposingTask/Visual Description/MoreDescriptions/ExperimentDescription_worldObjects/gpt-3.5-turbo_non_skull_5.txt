The skull is a rounded and somewhat rectangular-shaped object. It's the bony structure that protects the brain inside our heads. The most distinctive features of a skull are the eye sockets, which are two deep hollows located in the front, about halfway up the skull. They are roughly circular and sit symmetrically on both sides of the skull. Just above the eye sockets, there are the two dome-like structures known as the forehead. Moving down from the forehead, you'll notice the bridge of the nose, which is a thin, elongated area connecting the eye sockets. Below that, there is the upper jawbone, often called the maxilla, which provides support for the teeth. Moving towards the back of the skull, you'll find the temples, which are slightly indented on each side. At the very back, there is a bumpy area called the occiput, where the skull meets the neck. The skull rests on top of the neck, with its bottom surface being flat and horizontal. Remember, this description is focused on the essential elements and does not include intricate details.
