The skull is a bony structure that forms the head of most vertebrates, including humans. It has a distinct shape that looks like an oval when viewed from the front. The top part of the skull is domed and smooth, while the lower part resembles a slightly flattened curve.

The most prominent feature of the skull is the eye sockets, which are two hollow spaces on the front part of the skull. They are placed symmetrically on either side of the upper portion of the skull. Just below the eye sockets, you will find the nasal cavity, which is a long, narrow opening.

Moving towards the back of the skull, there are two bony protrusions on either side, known as the temporal bones. These bones help to protect the delicate structures inside the ear. Between the temporal bones, there is a large opening called the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord passes through.

On the lower portion of the skull, you will notice a central vertical ridge, known as the sagittal suture. It runs from the top of the skull to the back, dividing it into two halves. At the front of the skull, there is a smaller ridge called the coronal suture, which runs horizontally.

The skull has an overall symmetrical structure, with balanced proportions and alignments between its elements. It is a key identifier of a human or animal, and its distinctive features such as eye sockets, nasal cavity, and the shape of the cranium help in recognizing it.
