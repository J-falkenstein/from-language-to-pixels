The skull is a bony structure that forms the head of a person or animal. It has a rounded shape, resembling an oval. Starting from the top, imagine a smooth curve that gently slopes down towards the back, making the back of the skull slightly wider. The top part of the skull is more flat and elongated compared to the rounded sides.

At the front, there is a slightly curved forehead area that slopes inward towards the middle, creating a small depression called the brow ridge. Just below the brow ridge, you'll find the eye sockets, which are like hollow spaces where the eyes would usually be. These sockets are positioned on either side of the forehead and can be imagined as two slightly elongated oval shapes.

Moving downwards, there is a nasal cavity in the middle of the face, which can be represented by a simple triangular shape. The nose area is slightly protruding and sits between the eye sockets. Just below the nose, imagine a horizontal line that represents the opening of the mouth.

On the sides of the skull, towards the back, there are two structures that can be emphasized to help recognize it. These are the external ears, known as the ear lobes or pinnae. They are typically positioned in alignment with the eye sockets and bottom portion of the nose.

Remember, this description is focused on the main features necessary for recognizing a skull. Additional details like specific bumps, teeth, or smaller nuances are not necessary for drawing a simplified sketch.
