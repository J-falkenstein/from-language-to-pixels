The object I'm describing is a skull. 

Shape: The skull has a rounded shape, resembling an upside-down bowl. 

Distinctive features: The most important features of a skull include the eye sockets, nasal cavity, and the large hole for the mouth. The eye sockets are two hollow areas that are slightly sunken and oval-shaped. They are located towards the front of the skull and are parallel to each other. Just below the eye sockets is the nasal cavity, which is a long, narrow opening that starts between the eyes and extends downwards. Finally, the mouth hole is a larger opening situated below the nasal cavity. It has a curved shape and is wider than the eye sockets.

Proportions and alignments: The eye sockets are positioned symmetrically on either side of the central axis of the skull. The nasal cavity runs vertically between the eye sockets, aligning with the placement of the eyes. The mouth hole is located beneath the nasal cavity, aligned with the lower part of the nasal cavity.

Spatial relationships: The eye sockets are situated higher on the skull compared to the nasal cavity and mouth hole, which are stacked vertically below each other. The eye sockets are closer to the top of the skull, whereas the nasal cavity and mouth hole are positioned towards the lower part.

By considering these visual characteristics, you can now create a simplified sketch of a skull.
