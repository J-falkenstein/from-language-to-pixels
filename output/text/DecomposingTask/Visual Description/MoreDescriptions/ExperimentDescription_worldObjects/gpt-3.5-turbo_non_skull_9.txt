The object I will describe is a skull. 

Fundamental Shape:
The skull has a rounded, oval-like shape overall, resembling a slightly flattened ball.

Distinctive Features:
1. Eye Sockets: At the front of the skull, there are two deep, concave hollows that are positioned horizontally, resembling shallow bowls.
2. Nose Hole: In the middle of the skull, there is a larger, elongated hole positioned vertically, resembling a narrow slit.
3. Teeth: Beneath the eye sockets and nose hole, there is a curved row of sharp, pointed structures, representing the teeth. It curves upwards, mirroring the upper jaw.
4. Jawline: Surrounding the lower portion of the skull, there is a curved, bony structure forming the jawline. It connects to the base of the skull and curves upwards towards the ear area.

Proportions, Alignments, and Spatial Relationships:
1. Eye Sockets: The eye sockets are positioned symmetrically on both sides of the skull, creating bilateral symmetry.
2. Nose Hole: The nose hole is centrally located, aligning with the vertical center of the skull.
3. Teeth: The teeth are aligned with the bottom edge of the eye sockets and the top edge of the nose hole, forming a continuous row.
4. Jawline: The jawline starts from the lower part of the eye sockets, curves downwards, and then follows the shape of the skull until it reaches the area near the ears.

By focusing on these key features and their relationships, one can create a simplified sketch of a skull, enabling a blind person to have an idea of what it looks like.
