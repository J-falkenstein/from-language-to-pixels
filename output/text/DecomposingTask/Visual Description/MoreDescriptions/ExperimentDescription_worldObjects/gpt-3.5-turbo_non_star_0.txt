A star is a symbol commonly seen in drawings and represents a luminous celestial body. To help you draw a simplified sketch of a star, imagine a five-pointed shape. Each point of the star looks like a sharp, elongated triangle that tapers inward towards the center. The star's points should be evenly spaced and not overly rounded. The lines forming the points should be straight and distinct.

The length of each point should be relatively similar, ensuring that no point stands out prominently longer than the others. The distance between the points should also be relatively equal, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance.

Remember that a star's points all converge towards the center, so the lines forming the points should align at a central point where they meet. These lines should not cross each other, but rather extend from the center outwards, maintaining an organized and cohesive shape.

By focusing on these distinctive features and the overall shape of a star, you can create a simplified sketch that represents this celestial symbol.
