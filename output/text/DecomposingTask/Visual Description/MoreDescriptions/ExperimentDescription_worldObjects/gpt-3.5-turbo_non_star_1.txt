A star is a celestial object that is often seen as a symbol with five or more pointed ends. It has a symmetrical shape resembling intersecting lines. Imagine a shape made up of multiple straight lines extending from a central point. These lines can be equal in length or longer at certain points to create a dynamic appearance. The ends of the lines form distinctive points, which give the star its unique look.

To draw a simplified sketch of a star, visualize a big dot in the center of your paper. From this dot, draw five straight lines radiating outwards in different directions, making sure they are evenly spaced apart. Each line should extend beyond the dot and end with a pointy tip. The lines may intersect each other slightly, forming overlapping sections. The lines should be of similar length and proportionate to the size of the central dot.

Remember, stars can vary in size and shape, so feel free to adjust the proportions and angles according to your preference. Keep in mind, the key aspect is the distinctive points formed by the lines radiating from a central point.
