The object I'm describing is a star. 

Shape: A star is typically seen as a symmetrical shape consisting of five or more pointed arms that radiate outward from a central point.

Distinctive features: The points on each arm are sharp and elongated, resembling a narrow triangle. The arms are evenly spaced around the central point, creating a balanced and circular arrangement. The arms can be of equal length or varying lengths, depending on the design.

Proportions: The size of a star can vary greatly, from small decorative ones to large celestial stars visible in the night sky. In a simplified sketch, the size can be represented by a circle or an oval to indicate the overall scale.

Alignments and spatial relationships: The arms of the star are aligned radially from the central point, extending outward in a straight or slightly curved manner. They do not intersect or overlap with each other. The angles between the arms can be equal or slightly different, but they maintain a consistent distance from one another.

These descriptions should help a blind person create a simplified sketch of a star, capturing its fundamental shape, distinctive features, and spatial relationships.
