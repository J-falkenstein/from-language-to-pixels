A star is a celestial object that can be recognized by its distinctive shape. It has a basic shape of a five-pointed figure. The points of the star are evenly spaced and are connected by straight lines. The size of a star can vary, but typically it appears smaller than other objects in the night sky. Stars are located at various distances from Earth, so their size in the sky may differ. When drawing a star, it is important to emphasize the five points and the straight lines connecting them. The points should be evenly spaced around a central imaginary circle. Remember to keep the lines straight and the angles between them equal. This will create a recognizable depiction of a star, even without the intricate details that may be visible in actual stars.
