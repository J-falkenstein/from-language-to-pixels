A star is a symmetrical shape that is typically used to represent celestial bodies. It consists of a series of straight lines that emanate from a central point. The most important feature of a star is its pointed ends, which give it a distinct look. The lines extend outward from the center to form a shape that resembles a starburst or a multi-pointed shape. Each line is evenly spaced, giving the star a balanced and uniform appearance. The length of the lines can vary, but they are all connected at the center, creating a focal point. The star can be drawn in various sizes, but the overall proportions should maintain the balance between the length of the lines and the central point.
