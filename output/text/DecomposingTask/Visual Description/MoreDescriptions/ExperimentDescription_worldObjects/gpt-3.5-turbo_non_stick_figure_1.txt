Stick Figure:
A stick figure is a simple drawing that resembles a person. It consists of a vertical straight line for the body and a small circle on top for the head. The circle is positioned at the top of the line, representing the head being connected to the body. Two short lines extend out from the bottom of the body, representing the legs. These legs are positioned straight down from the body, with equal spacing on both sides. At the end of each leg, there is another small circle, representing the feet. Additionally, two smaller vertical lines are drawn from the center of the body, representing the arms. The arms are positioned slightly away from the body, pointing downwards. That's a stick figure!
