A stick figure is a simple and recognizable representation of a human or animal. It consists of a vertical line as the body and usually shorter horizontal lines as limbs. The head is represented by a circle or oval shape at the top of the vertical line. The arms and legs are attached to the body with short lines which serve as joints. 

To draw a stick figure, start by drawing a straight vertical line in the center of your paper. This line represents the body. At the top of the line, draw a small circle or oval shape for the head. This is the most distinctive feature of the stick figure.

For the arms, draw two short lines extending outward from the sides of the body, around midway or slightly below the head level. These lines should be shorter than the body and can slightly bend to represent the elbows. Similarly, for the legs, draw two short lines extending downward from the bottom of the body. These lines should also be shorter than the body and can slightly bend to represent the knees.

Remember to keep the limbs proportionate to the body. The length of the arms and legs should be similar to each other and to the body. Keeping the limbs shorter helps simplify the sketch and maintain the stick figure's recognizable shape.

The stick figure can be oriented facing forward or in any desired direction. This can be conveyed by the position and angle of the head and limbs. Positioning the head and limbs at different angles can add dynamics to the movement of the stick figure.

Overall, a stick figure is a simplified representation of a human or animal body, consisting of a vertical line for the body, a circle or oval for the head, and shorter lines for the arms and legs. It is a basic and easily recognizable sketch used to depict human or animal figures.
