The stick figure is a simple and iconic representation of a human form. It consists of basic lines and shapes that create a recognizable silhouette. 

To draw a stick figure, start with a vertical line that represents the central axis of the body. This line can be considered the spine of the figure. 

Next, at the top of the vertical line, draw a small circle for the head. The circle should be proportionate to the size of the body. 

For the arms, draw two horizontal lines originating from the sides of the head circle. These lines can be shorter or longer depending on the desired arm length. 

At the bottom of the vertical line, draw a larger circle or oval shape for the torso. This shape can be wider than the head circle to represent the chest area. 

From the bottom of the torso shape, draw two vertical lines for the legs. These lines can be slightly angled to portray a natural stance. 

At the end of each leg line, draw another smaller circle or oval shape to indicate the feet. These shapes can be simplified and not necessarily need to show detailed toes or footwear. 

Once these main elements are drawn, you can add additional details if desired, such as lines to represent fingers or simple facial features like dots for eyes and a curved line for the mouth. However, these details are not essential to create a recognizable stick figure. 

Remember, the primary focus is on capturing the overall shape and proportions of the stick figure, emphasizing a vertical orientation for the body, circular shapes for the head and joints, and horizontal lines for the arms and legs.
