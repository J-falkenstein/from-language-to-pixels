The stick figure is a simple representation of a human or animal. It is composed of straight lines, resembling a skeleton. The main shape is formed by a vertical line, which represents the body, and a horizontal line, which represents the arms. The head is depicted as a small circular shape at the top of the vertical line. The arms extend out from the sides of the body, with small lines at the ends to represent hands. The legs are represented by two vertical lines extending downward from the body, with small lines at the ends to indicate feet. The stick figure does not have any facial features or distinct body parts. It is a minimal and easily recognizable symbol for a person or animal.
