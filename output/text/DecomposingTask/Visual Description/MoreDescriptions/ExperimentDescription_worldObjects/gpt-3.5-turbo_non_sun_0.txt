The sun is a round and radiant celestial object that brightens our day. It is like a perfect circle in the sky, glowing with a golden or yellowish color. Its brightness is intense and illuminates the surroundings. The sun can be seen during the day and appears to be at the center of the sky, casting light in all directions. It is much larger than any other objects we see in the daytime sky, like buildings or trees. Remember, it's crucial to never look directly at the sun to protect your eyes.
