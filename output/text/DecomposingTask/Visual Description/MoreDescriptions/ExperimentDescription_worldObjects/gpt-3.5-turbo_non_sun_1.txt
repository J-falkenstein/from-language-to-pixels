The sun is a large celestial object that appears as a bright, glowing circle in the sky during the day. It has a perfectly round shape with no edges or corners. The most distinctive feature of the sun is its intense brightness, which makes it stand out against the surrounding sky. It radiates a warm and yellowish light, illuminating everything in its path. The sun is positioned high up in the sky, usually at an angle, providing light and warmth to the Earth. Its location can be quite far from the horizon or directly overhead, depending on the time of day and the observer's location. When drawing the sun, focus on capturing its round shape and the brightness it emits, these are the most important features to convey its identity.
