The sun is a large celestial body that appears as a bright, round, and disc-like shape in the sky during the day. Imagine a perfect circle with a glowing, radiant center. It is important to convey that the sun is much larger than any other object in the sky, such as the moon or stars.

While drawing a simplified sketch of the sun, focus on capturing its round shape, filling the entire space. Use wavy lines emanating from the center to represent rays of light extending outward in all directions. These rays can be long or short, irregular, and not perfectly straight. Remember to emphasize that the sun is a source of light and warmth.

It's important to mention that the sun is typically positioned at the top of the sky during daytime. So, if you include any other elements in the drawing, position them below the sun to indicate the higher spatial relationship.

Overall, a simplified sketch of the sun would consist of a large, round circle with wavy lines extending from the center in all directions to represent its radiant rays.
