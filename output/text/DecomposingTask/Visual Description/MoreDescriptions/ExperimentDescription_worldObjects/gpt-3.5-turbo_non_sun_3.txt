The object I am describing is the sun. It is a large, round shape that appears as a bright, shining ball of light in the sky during the day. The sun is the center of our solar system and is much bigger than the Earth. It has a radiant yellow or orange color, and its brightness can sometimes make it difficult to look directly at without protection. The sun is positioned high above the horizon during the day. It is often surrounded by a clear, blue sky during sunny weather. The sun provides light and heat to Earth, and its rays extend in all directions, illuminating everything around us. Its presence is essential for life on our planet.
