The sun is a round, circular shape in the sky, like a perfectly formed ball. It radiates a bright and vibrant light that illuminates the entire sky during the day. Its fiery glow gives it a distinctive appearance, as it emits a warm, yellowish color that spreads across the horizon. The sun is positioned above us, commonly seen as a glowing orb that hangs high in the sky. It is significantly larger than any other object we perceive in the daytime sky, and its size stands out in comparison to other elements such as clouds or birds. Its radiant beams extend outward in all directions, creating a sense of warmth and brightness. Overall, the sun can be visualized as a large, glowing, circular entity that dominates the daytime sky, filling it with light and casting shadows in the process.
