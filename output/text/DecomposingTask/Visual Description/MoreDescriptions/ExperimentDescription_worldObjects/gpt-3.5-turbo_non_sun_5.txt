The sun is a large, round shape in the sky. It is bright and emits a warm, golden light. At the center of the sun, there is a smaller circular shape called the core. Surrounding the core, there are multiple wavy lines that radiate outward in all directions. These lines represent the sun's rays. The rays are irregularly spaced and vary in length, extending far beyond the core. The rays give the impression of energy and warmth emanating from the center of the sun. Overall, the sun has a symmetrical appearance, with the rays evenly distributed around the core. Remember, the sun should be depicted as the main focal point in the sky, surrounded by a clear background indicating the open space.
