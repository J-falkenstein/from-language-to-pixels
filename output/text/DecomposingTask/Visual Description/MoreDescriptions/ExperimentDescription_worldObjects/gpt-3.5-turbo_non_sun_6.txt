The object I would like to describe is the sun.

The sun is a round and circular shape, resembling a perfectly symmetrical and radiant disc in the sky. It is immense in size and appears significantly larger than any other celestial body visible from Earth. The color of the sun is bright and vibrant, emitting a warm and golden glow.

One of the distinctive features of the sun is the corona, which appears as a glowing halo surrounding the circular shape. The corona is composed of wispy, delicate rays extending outward in all directions, giving the impression of fiery tendrils reaching into space.

In terms of proportions, the sun is the dominant element in our solar system, with all other planets revolving around it. Its immense size and brilliance make it unquestionably the most prominent object we see during the day. 

When observed from Earth, the sun typically appears aligned with the horizon during sunrise and sunset, casting beautiful hues of orange, pink, and red across the sky. Its position can help in understanding the time of day and provides a sense of direction.

Overall, the sun can be represented in a simplified sketch by drawing a perfect circle with the corona represented by a series of lines extending outward from the circumference. The size and position of the sun in relation to other elements can be conveyed by ensuring it stands out as the largest and central figure in the sketch.
