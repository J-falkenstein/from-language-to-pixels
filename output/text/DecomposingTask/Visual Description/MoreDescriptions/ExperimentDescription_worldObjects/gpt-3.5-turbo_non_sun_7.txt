The sun is a large, round celestial object that hangs high in the sky during the day. Its basic shape can be described as a perfect circle. It emits a bright, warm light that illuminates everything around it. The most distinctive feature of the sun is its intense brightness, which is much brighter than any other object in the sky. 

To draw a simplified sketch of the sun, you can start by drawing a medium-sized circle in the center of your paper. This circle represents the sun's main body. Then, add rays extending outward from the edges of the circle. These rays can be drawn as simple straight lines radiating in all directions, like spokes on a wheel. There is no need to count or draw a specific number of rays, as they can vary in real life.

Remember to emphasize the brightness of the sun in your sketch. You can add some lines or shading around the perimeter of the circle to represent the intense light radiating from it.

Lastly, keep in mind that the sun is usually depicted in the top half of the page, as it appears high in the sky. This will help convey its position and relevant spatial relationship with other elements in the drawing.

Overall, focus on capturing the simplicity of the sun's shape, the intensity of its brightness, and its position in the sky to create a simplified sketch that enables a blind person to recognize it.
