The sun is a large, round shape in the sky. It is often depicted as a perfect circle. The most distinctive feature of the sun is its bright, intense light. It shines down on everything and makes other objects appear illuminated. 

In terms of proportions, the sun is much bigger than anything else in the sky. It stands out against the background and is typically seen as the brightest and largest object during the daytime. 

The sun is generally positioned directly above us, in the center of the sky during the day. It appears as if it is radiating light and warmth in all directions. 

To draw a simplified sketch of the sun, you can start by drawing a large circle in the center of your paper. Then, you can add rays or lines coming out from the circle to represent its radiating light. Remember to leave the center of the circle empty, as the sun appears as a bright spot rather than a solid shape.
