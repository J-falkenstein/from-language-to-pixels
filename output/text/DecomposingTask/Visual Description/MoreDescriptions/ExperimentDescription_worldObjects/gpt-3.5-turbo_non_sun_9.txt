The sun is a large, round, and glowing object in the sky. It can be described as a perfect circle, radiating dazzling light and warmth. Its distinctive feature is its vibrant yellow color, which shines brightly against the blue sky during the day. The sun is positioned above us, appearing to be at the center of our universe. It is much bigger than any other object we see in the sky, including the moon and stars. While it may appear to move throughout the day, its position is generally higher during midday and lower near the horizon during sunrise and sunset. Remember, it is important to never try to directly observe or touch the sun, as it can be harmful to our eyes and skin.
