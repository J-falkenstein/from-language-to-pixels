The object I am describing is a window. It is typically rectangular in shape, with four straight sides forming a frame. The frame is usually made of wood, metal, or plastic. 

At the center of the window is a transparent pane of glass that allows light to pass through. The glass is usually smooth and flat, with no visible patterns or textures. It is held in place within the frame by smaller strips or dividers called mullions. 

The window is divided into sections by these mullions, creating a grid-like pattern. The number and arrangement of mullions can vary depending on the window design. 

The proportions of the window can vary, but it is typically taller than it is wide. The height can be further divided by a horizontal mullion called a transom, creating an upper and lower portion within the window. 

The window is often positioned within a wall, with the frame flush against the wall surface. It either opens on hinges like a door or slides horizontally or vertically to allow airflow. However, these opening mechanisms may not be visually distinguishable.

Overall, the window's key features are its rectangular shape, the presence of a transparent glass pane, the frame that holds the glass in place, and the grid-like pattern created by the mullions. These characteristics should enable you to create a simplified sketch of a window.
