A window is a rectangular opening in a wall or an object that allows light and air to pass through. It is commonly made of a sturdy frame, usually made of wood or metal, surrounding a transparent material called glass. 

The fundamental shape of a window is rectangular, having two longer sides and two shorter sides. The longer sides are typically vertical, while the shorter sides are horizontal. The proportions of the window can vary, but it is usually taller than it is wide. 

One of the distinctive features of a window is the glass pane that covers most of the opening. Glass is smooth and transparent, enabling you to see through it. It is important to note that some windows may have multiple panes of glass, separated by small mullions or frames within the larger frame. 

The window frame holds the glass in place and provides support and stability. It can be thick or thin, depending on the type of window. The frame may also have additional elements such as hinges or handles for opening and closing the window. 

In terms of spatial relationships, a window is often found on the exterior walls of buildings, allowing light to enter the interior space. It is positioned at a height that is convenient for viewing outside and can be aligned with other windows or architectural elements. 

To summarize, a window is a rectangular opening in a wall with a transparent glass pane held in place by a frame. Its fundamental shape is rectangular, with vertical longer sides and horizontal shorter sides. The glass is smooth and transparent, providing visibility. The frame supports the glass and may have additional features like hinges or handles. Overall, a window serves as an opening for light and air, enabling one to see outside while maintaining separation between interior and exterior spaces.
