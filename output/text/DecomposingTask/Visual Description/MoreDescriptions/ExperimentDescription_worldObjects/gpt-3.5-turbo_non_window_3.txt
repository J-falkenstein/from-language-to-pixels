The object is a rectangular shape, taller than it is wide. It is made of a transparent material that allows light to pass through. The top and bottom edges of the object are straight and parallel to each other. The sides of the object are also straight and perpendicular to the top and bottom edges. 

In the center of the rectangular shape, there is a vertical line that divides it into two equal parts. This line runs from the top to the bottom edge, creating a symmetrical appearance. 

Towards the top of the rectangle, there is a horizontal line that extends from one side to the other. This line is positioned slightly below the top edge. It divides the upper part of the rectangle into smaller sections. 

On both sides of the vertical line, there are smaller horizontal lines that extend from the vertical line towards the sides of the rectangle. These lines divide the lower part of the rectangle into even smaller sections. 

Overall, the object has a simple, clean design with straight lines and a clear division between the upper and lower parts. It is primarily used to allow light and air into a room while providing a view to the outside.
