A window is a rectangular-shaped opening in a wall or a frame, typically made of glass or transparent material. It is usually taller than it is wide, but the proportions can vary. The top and bottom edges are parallel to each other, forming horizontal lines.

In the center of the window, there is a vertical line called the mullion, which divides the window into two equal parts. This line helps to support the structure and may be more noticeable in older window designs.

Looking through the window, you can see the outside world. The glass is transparent, allowing light to pass through, creating a clear view. If the window is closed, there may be a small gap between the glass and the frame, creating a thin line around the edges.

On the frame surrounding the glass, there might be small patterns or designs, but they are not essential to recognize the object. The focus should be on the rectangular shape, the transparent glass, and the vertical mullion in the middle.

Remember, the purpose of a window is to let light in and provide a view of the outside, so these are the most important features to convey when trying to sketch a window.
