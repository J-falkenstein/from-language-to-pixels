A window is a rectangular opening in a wall or surface, typically made of glass. Its shape can be described as a tall, vertical rectangle with straight edges. The most important feature of a window is the transparency it offers, allowing light to pass through and providing a view of the outside world. 

The frame of a window surrounds the glass and provides support. It can be made of different materials such as wood, metal, or plastic. The frame is usually thicker than the glass, emphasizing the distinction between the two elements. 

Proportions and spatial relationships are important to consider when describing a window. The width and height of a window can vary, but it typically follows the proportions of a rectangle. The width is usually larger than the height, which gives the window its distinctive shape.

When describing a window's position in a building, you can mention its alignment with other elements. For example, a window can be located in the center of a wall, aligned with other windows or architectural features. 

Overall, a window can be described as a vertical rectangular opening with glass, framed by a thicker border, allowing light and views from the outside.
