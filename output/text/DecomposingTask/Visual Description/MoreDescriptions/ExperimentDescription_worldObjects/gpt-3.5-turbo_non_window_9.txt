A window is a rectangular opening in a wall, usually made of glass, which allows light and air to enter a room. The most important characteristic of a window is its shape, which is typically a rectangle. It is important to note the proportions of the window, as it is typically taller than it is wide, but this can vary depending on the design.

The distinctive features of a window include the presence of a frame that surrounds the glass pane(s). This frame can be made of various materials, such as wood, metal, or plastic. The frame helps to hold the glass in place and provides support for the window.

When considering alignments and spatial relationships, a window is often positioned within a wall, typically at eye level or higher. It can be centered within the wall or located closer to one side, depending on the symmetry desired in the design of the building.

It's important to note that a window can have additional elements such as handles, latches, or blinds, but these are considered details and not necessary for a simplified sketch that focuses on the fundamental characteristics of the object.

In summary, a window can be described as a rectangular opening in a wall, usually taller than it is wide. It has a frame surrounding a glass pane and is typically positioned within the wall at eye level or higher.
