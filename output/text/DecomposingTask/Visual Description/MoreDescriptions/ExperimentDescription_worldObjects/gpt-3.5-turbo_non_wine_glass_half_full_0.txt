The object is a wine glass that is half full. 

The fundamental shape of the wine glass is like an elongated oval or an inverted cone. It has a narrow top opening, which gradually widens towards the middle and then tapers down to a circular base. 

Distinctive features of the wine glass include a long stem attached to the base, which elevates the glass from the surface it rests on. The stem is straight and slender, providing a stable foundation for the glass. On top of the stem, there is a bowl-shaped cup that serves as the holding area for the wine. The cup is wider towards the top and gradually narrows towards the bottom. 

The wine glass is half full, meaning there is liquid filling up to the halfway point of the cup. This can be illustrated by drawing a curved line horizontally across the cup, marking the boundary where the liquid ends. 

To help with proportions, the height of the stem is usually twice or slightly more than the height of the cup. The cup's width at the top is usually wider than the base. 

In terms of relevant spatial relationships, the stem is positioned centrally beneath the cup, connecting the base and the cup, forming a vertical alignment. The cup is aligned directly above the base, resting securely on the stem. 

By following these descriptions, a simplified sketch of a wine glass half full can be created, focusing on the essential features and proportions to convey its recognition.
