The object is a wine glass that is half full. It has a tapered shape, wider at the bottom and narrower towards the top. The glass stands on a thin stem that connects to a circular base. 

Starting from the base, the stem extends upward in a straight vertical line. The stem reaches a certain height and then curves outward, forming a graceful curve that widens into a bowl-shaped structure. The bowl is the main part where the wine is held. 

The bowl of the glass is distinguishable by its smooth and rounded edges. It is wider at the middle and tapers slightly towards the top. As the glass is half full, you can imagine the wine reaching about the midpoint of the bowl, creating a visible meniscus or curved surface at the top of the liquid. 

The glass also possesses a short and rounded rim at the top of the bowl, which is where you would drink from. The rim is aligned horizontally and is perpendicular to the stem. 

Overall, the shape of the wine glass, along with its stem, bowl, and half-filled liquid, combine to create a recognizable object that enables you to enjoy and appreciate your favorite wine.
