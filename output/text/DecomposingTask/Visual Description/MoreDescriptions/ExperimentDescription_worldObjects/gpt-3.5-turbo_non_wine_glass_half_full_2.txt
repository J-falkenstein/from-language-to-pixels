The object is a wine glass that is half full. It has a tall and slender shape with a slightly wider base that tapers upwards. The glass is transparent, allowing you to see the liquid inside. 

Starting from the bottom, the base is flat and round, providing stability. As we move up, the stem extends upwards from the base. It is thin and straight, connecting the base to the bowl of the glass. 

The bowl is the most distinct feature of the wine glass. It has a rounded and elongated shape, narrowing towards the rim. At the halfway point, the glass is filled with wine, reaching the middle of the bowl. This half-full level creates a visible line where the liquid surface meets the glass.

The rim of the glass is thin and circular, providing a smooth edge for drinking. It is slightly wider than the rest of the glass but maintains the overall shape of the bowl. 

Overall, the glass has a graceful and elegant appearance, with the liquid inside providing a clear distinction between the glass and the wine.
