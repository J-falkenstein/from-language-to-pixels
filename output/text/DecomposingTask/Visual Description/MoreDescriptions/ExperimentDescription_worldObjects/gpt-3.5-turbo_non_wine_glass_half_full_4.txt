The object is a wine glass that is half full. 

Fundamental Shape: The wine glass has a tall and slender silhouette. It is narrower at the top and gradually widens towards the base. 

Distinctive Features: The stem of the wine glass is long and thin, connecting the base to the bowl. The bowl is the upper part of the glass where the wine is held. It has a rounded shape, resembling a shallow bowl or an inverted cone. 

Proportions: The stem is relatively long compared to the overall height of the glass, and it extends vertically from the base. The bowl occupies a significant portion of the glass height, typically slightly less than half. 

Alignment: The bowl is positioned centrally on top of the stem, with its widest part at the top, tapering down towards the stem. The stem aligns vertically from the center of the base to the center of the bowl. 

Spatial Relationships: The bowl is situated above the stem and the base, with the stem acting as a connector between them. The base is wider and provides stability to the glass. The half-filled section of the glass is located within the bowl and generally fills half of its capacity. 

Overall, the wine glass is characterized by its elongated, slender shape, a distinctive stem connecting the base to the bowl, and a rounded, shallow bowl or cone-like structure holding the liquid, with the wine filling approximately half of its volume.
