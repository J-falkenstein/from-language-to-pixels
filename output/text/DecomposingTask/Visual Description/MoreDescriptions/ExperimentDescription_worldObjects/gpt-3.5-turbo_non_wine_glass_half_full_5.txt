The object is a wine glass that is half full. 

Shape: The wine glass is cylindrical in shape with a slightly tapered top. It has a narrow and tall body.

Distinctive features: The glass has a stem that connects the bowl of the glass to the base. The bowl, which is the top part of the glass, has a rounded shape. The rim of the bowl is smooth and slightly curved.

Proportions: The height of the glass is much taller than its width. The stem is long and thin, proportionate to the bowl. The bowl is wider at the bottom and tapers slightly towards the rim.

Alignments and spatial relationships: The stem of the glass is aligned vertically with the base, which is wider and provides stability to the glass. The bowl is positioned on top of the stem and is centered. The level of the wine fills the glass halfway, reaching the midpoint between the base and the rim.

By focusing on these key details, the blind person can create a simplified sketch of a wine glass that is half full.
