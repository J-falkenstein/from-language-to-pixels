The wine glass half full has a slender and elongated shape, tapering towards its rim. Its body is composed of a clear, cylindrical stem that connects to a rounded bowl. The bowl is wider at the base and gradually narrows towards the rim. Its most distinctive feature is the level of liquid inside, which fills exactly half of the bowl. 

To visualize the proportions, imagine a tall glass with a stem that is approximately three times the length of the bowl's height. The bowl itself should have a width at the base that is slightly wider than the stem's diameter. As you move upwards, the bowl gently curves inwards, creating a graceful silhouette. 

The stem of the wine glass aligns vertically with the center of the base, providing stability to the overall structure. The base itself is flat and circular, allowing the glass to stand firmly on a surface. 

In summary, the wine glass half full is an elegant and delicate object with an elongated stem, a rounded bowl that narrows towards the rim, and a proportionate base. Its most significant feature is the level of liquid filling exactly half of the bowl.
