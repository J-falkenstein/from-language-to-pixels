The wine glass half full is composed of a tall, slender, and elongated cylindrical shape. Its primary feature is the curved rim that forms an open circular opening at the top. The rim gently slopes downwards towards the stem, creating a smooth transition.

The glass's most distinctive feature is its stem which extends from the base of the bowl to the circular foot. The stem is long and thin, serving as a connection between the bowl and the foot. The foot is a smaller circular shape that provides stability to the glass. 

To visualize the proportions, the height of the glass is approximately three times the diameter of the bowl's opening. The bowl itself has a wider middle section that gracefully narrows towards the bottom, resembling an inverted cone shape. 

When describing spatial relationships, the rim should be positioned at the topmost section of the glass, while the stem extends vertically downwards from the middle of the bowl, meeting the circular foot at the bottom. The bowl should be centered directly above the foot, ensuring balance and stability.

Overall, the wine glass half full is characterized by its tall cylindrical shape, curved rim, long stem, and circular foot.
