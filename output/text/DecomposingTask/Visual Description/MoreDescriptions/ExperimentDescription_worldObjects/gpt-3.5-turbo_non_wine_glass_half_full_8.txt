The object is a wine glass that is half full. The main shape of the glass is an elongated oval, tapering towards the top. The glass stands on a thin, cylindrical stem that connects to a circular base. The base provides stability to the glass. 

Starting from the bottom, the stem is vertically aligned with the center of the base. As it ascends, the stem widens slightly, then gracefully curves into the bowl of the glass. The bowl has a smooth, rounded shape, wider at the middle and tapering towards the rim. 

The most distinctive feature is the fluid within the glass, filling it halfway. The liquid creates a curved surface inside the glass, following the shape of the bowl. The reflection of light on the liquid may also be visible, depending on the surrounding environment.

Overall, the wine glass half full has a balanced and elegant appearance. The key elements to remember are the elongated oval shape, the cylindrical stem, the circular base, the smooth rounded bowl, and the distinct curve of the liquid within.
