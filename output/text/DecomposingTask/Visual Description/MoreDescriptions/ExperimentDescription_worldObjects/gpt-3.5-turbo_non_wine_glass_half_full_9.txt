The object is a wine glass that is filled halfway with liquid. 

The wine glass is primarily shaped like an elongated cone, with a wide round base that narrows to a slender stem and then opens up into a wider bowl at the top. 

The distinctive features of the wine glass include its tall and slender stem, which connects the base and the bowl. The stem is relatively thin and vertical, providing stability to the glass. At the top of the stem, the bowl begins, which is a rounded and open shape. 

To describe the proportions, the base of the glass is wider than the stem and bowl. The stem is roughly one-third the height of the overall glass, while the bowl occupies the remaining two-thirds. 

Regarding the alignment and spatial relationships, the stem is centered vertically below the bowl. The bowl itself is positioned above the stem and slightly tilted towards the opening, creating a slight angle. The liquid fills the bowl halfway, reaching the center of the glass. 

Overall, the wine glass half full is easily recognizable by its distinctive shape, with a wide round base, a slender vertical stem, and a rounded open bowl that holds the liquid.
