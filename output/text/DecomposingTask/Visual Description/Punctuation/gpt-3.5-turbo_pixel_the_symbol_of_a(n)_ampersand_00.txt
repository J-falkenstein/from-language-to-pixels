A simplified visual representation of the symbol of an ampersand in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a vertical line, slightly curved to the right at the top, which extends slightly below the baseline. On the top right of this line, a smaller curved line is connected diagonally, pointing towards the top left. The angle of this diagonal line is about 45 degrees. The top left of the vertical line has a slight curve to the left, mirroring the curve at the top. The overall proportion of the symbol in this 8x8 pixel artwork should be relatively balanced, with the vertical line taking up about two-thirds of the height and the diagonal line occupying roughly one-third of the width.
