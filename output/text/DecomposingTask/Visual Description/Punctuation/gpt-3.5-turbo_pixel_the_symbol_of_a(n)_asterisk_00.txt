A simplified visual representation of the symbol of an asterisk can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. The asterisk symbol consists of five diagonal lines intersecting at a central point. 

To create the simplified 8x8 pixel artwork, we can use a "+" symbol to represent each intersection point of the lines. Starting from the top-left corner of the 8x8 grid, the first line extends diagonally from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, intersecting the "+" symbols at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4). 

The second line starts from the top-right corner, extends diagonally towards the bottom-left corner, and intersects the "+" symbols at positions (5,4), (4,3), (3,2), and (2,1).

The third line starts from the bottom-right corner, extends diagonally towards the top-left corner, and intersects the "+" symbols at positions (4,5), (3,6), (2,7), and (1,8).

The fourth line starts from the bottom-left corner, extends diagonally towards the top-right corner, and intersects the "+" symbols at positions (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), and (8,8).

The fifth line starts from the center of the grid and extends vertically, intersecting the "+" symbols at positions (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8).

By connecting these intersection points using straight lines formed by the "+" symbols, the simplified representation of an asterisk symbol can be achieved in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
