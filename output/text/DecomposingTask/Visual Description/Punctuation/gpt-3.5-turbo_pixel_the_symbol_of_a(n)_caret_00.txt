The symbol of a caret can be simplified into a small triangular shape pointing upwards. Start the artwork by creating a square canvas of 8x8 pixels. The caret symbol will be represented by a diagonal line running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the canvas. Ensure that the line is centered within the canvas, with equal empty space on both sides. The line should start at the second row of the first column and end at the second row of the eighth column, forming a 45-degree angle. The line should be one pixel thick to preserve simplicity. By following these instructions, you will create a simplified representation of the symbol of a caret that will be recognizable within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
