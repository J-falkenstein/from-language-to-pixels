A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a comma in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a small curved shape resembling half of a circle. The shape should start from the upper-left corner of the pixel grid and continue diagonally towards the lower-right corner, forming a smooth curve. The curve should occupy approximately 6 pixels in length, with the center of the curve located around the 4th pixel row. The top part of the curve should be slightly thinner than the bottom part to highlight the tail of the comma. The tail should extend downward from the curve, ending with a small horizontal segment. To emphasize the comma's shape, the remaining pixels should be left empty, creating a clear distinction between the comma and the surrounding space.
