A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a dollar sign can be created using an 8x8 pixel artwork. The fundamental shape of the dollar sign consists of two vertical lines intersected by one slightly slanted horizontal line in the middle.

Starting from the top-left corner of the 8x8 pixel canvas, the first vertical line occupies the first three pixels horizontally. It starts at the top pixel and extends downwards for three pixels. The second vertical line is placed two pixels away from the first line, starting from the fourth pixel. This line also extends downwards for three pixels.

The slightly slanted horizontal line intersects the two vertical lines, positioned at the fourth pixel from the top, crossing the first vertical line at the fourth pixel and the second vertical line at the sixth pixel. This line is inclined to the left at a small angle, ensuring recognition.

To emphasize the essential features, the representation omits any intricate details, such as serifs or curved endings, due to the limited canvas size. The proportions of the vertical and horizontal lines are maintained to preserve the recognizable shape. The alignment of the lines is crucial to accurately represent the symbol, with the horizontal line crossing the two vertical lines at specific positions.

Overall, this simplified rendition condenses the dollar sign symbol into an 8x8 pixel artwork by focusing on its fundamental shape, distinctive traits, and spatial relationships.
