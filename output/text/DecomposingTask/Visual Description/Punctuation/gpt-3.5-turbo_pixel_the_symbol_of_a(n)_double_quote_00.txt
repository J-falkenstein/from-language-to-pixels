A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a double quote would be an upright rectangle with a height of 8 pixels and a width of 2 pixels. The rectangle should be placed in the center of an 8x8 pixel canvas. The rectangle's top and bottom edges should align with the top and bottom edges of the canvas. The distinctive trait of the double quote symbol is its two vertical lines, representing the opening and closing quotation marks. These two lines should be evenly spaced within the rectangle, with a 1-pixel gap in the middle. The top line should start at the top-left corner of the rectangle and extend vertically to the middle, while the bottom line should start at the middle and extend vertically to the bottom-right corner of the rectangle. This simplified rendition emphasizes the essential features of the double quote symbol while omitting intricate details.
