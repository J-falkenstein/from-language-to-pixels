A simplified representation of the equal sign (âˆž) in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of two parallel horizontal lines. The upper line should be aligned with the topmost pixel row, while the lower line should align with the bottommost pixel row. Both lines are expected to be 2 pixels thick and evenly spaced, with only a single pixel of space separating them vertically. The length of the lines would be the same as the width of the 8x8 pixel grid. The equal sign symbolizes balance and equality, and its simplified representation should focus on maintaining the parallel alignment and the horizontal nature of the lines, while omitting any intricate details or curves due to the space limitations.
