A simplified visual representation of the symbol of an exclamation point in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a single vertical line, placed towards the top center of the canvas. The line would span the entire height of the canvas, occupying 3 pixels vertically. The line would be centered within the canvas horizontally, taking up 1 pixel. This representation would emphasize the essential shape of the exclamation point symbol, making it recognizable within the given constraints.
