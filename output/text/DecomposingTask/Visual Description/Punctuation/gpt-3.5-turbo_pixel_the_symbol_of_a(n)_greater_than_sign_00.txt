A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a greater than sign can be created using an 8x8 pixel artwork. The symbol consists of a single horizontal line pointing to the right. It starts from the top-left corner of the canvas and extends diagonally towards the bottom-right corner. The line occupies the top 6 pixels of the canvas, leaving the bottom 2 pixels empty. The line is bold and straight, ensuring good visibility. The proportions of the line should be maintained to preserve the recognizable shape of the greater than sign.
