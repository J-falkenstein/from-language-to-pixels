A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a hashtag can be created as an 8x8 pixel artwork with the following features:

The symbol consists of a grid of straight lines forming a cross-like shape. The vertical and horizontal lines intersect at the center of the symbol. The thickness of the lines should be equal and relatively thin to fit within the pixel constraints.

To maintain proportion and alignment, the length of each line should be half the height or width of the overall symbol. The lines should extend from the center to the edges of the artwork, creating four equal quadrants.

The intersections of the lines should be crisp and well-defined to ensure recognition. The space between the lines should be minimal to maintain clarity within the limited pixel canvas.

Due to the simplified nature of the representation, any additional embellishments or shading should be omitted to avoid complexity and allow for easy recognition at a small scale.

By focusing on these essential features of a cross-like shape with equal-sized quadrants, crisp intersections, and minimal spacing, the simplified 8x8 pixel artwork can effectively represent the symbol of a hashtag.
