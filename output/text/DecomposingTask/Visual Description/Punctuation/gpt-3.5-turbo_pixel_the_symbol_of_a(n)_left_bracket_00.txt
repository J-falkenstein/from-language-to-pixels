A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a left bracket can be created as an 8x8 pixel artwork by using a vertical line with a shorter horizontal line extending from its top end. The vertical line would stretch from the top to the bottom of the 8x8 pixel canvas, while the shorter horizontal line would be positioned towards the left side of the vertical line, slightly above its midpoint. The vertical line represents the main body of the left bracket, while the shorter horizontal line signifies the opening curve at the top of the bracket. The horizontal line should be roughly one-third of the length of the vertical line to maintain recognizable proportions. The alignment of the horizontal line should be slightly slanted to the right, creating a pleasing visual balance. The simplified rendition of the left bracket symbol should convey its fundamental shape and distinctive traits, allowing for easy recognition even within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
