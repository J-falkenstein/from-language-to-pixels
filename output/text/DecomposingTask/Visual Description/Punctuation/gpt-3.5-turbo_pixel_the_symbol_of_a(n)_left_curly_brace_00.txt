A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a left curly brace can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. 

The left curly brace consists of a vertical line on the left side, extending from the top to the bottom of the grid. At the top of this vertical line, there is a small curve that bends towards the right, forming the beginning of the brace shape. From there, the curve continues downwards, transitioning into a diagonal line that moves towards the right side of the grid. This diagonal line ends in a small curve at the bottom of the grid, completing the left curly brace shape. 

To emphasize the essential features for recognition in this simplified rendition, the curves may be slightly rounded. Due to the limited space, the brace may appear slightly compressed horizontally, but it should maintain a recognizable shape. The vertical line should be aligned with the left edge of the grid, while the diagonal line should follow a sloping angle towards the right side.
