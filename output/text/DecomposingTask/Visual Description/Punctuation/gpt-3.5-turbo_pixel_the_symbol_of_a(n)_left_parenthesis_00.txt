A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a left parenthesis for an 8x8 pixel artwork can be described as follows:

The left parenthesis symbol is a curved shape resembling a half-circle with an opening on the right side. The outer outline consists of a smooth curve that starts from the top-left corner and gradually curves downwards, reaching the bottom-left corner. The top and bottom borders are aligned horizontally at the same level, occupying two rows of the 8x8 grid. The gap or opening on the right side is represented by leaving the adjacent pixels blank, creating a space between the curved shape and the right edge of the artwork. The overall size of the symbol can be adjusted to fit 2 to 3 columns in the 8x8 grid, while preserving the curved shape's smoothness and the alignment of the top and bottom borders.
