In a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of the symbol of a less than sign, the fundamental shape can be represented by a diagonal line inclined towards the right, starting from the top-left corner of the canvas and ending at the bottom-right corner. The line should occupy the central four pixels vertically, with the remaining four pixels on each side left blank. The line should be thick enough to be visible and distinguishable. This simplified rendition focuses on the diagonal line, representing the concept of "less than," while omitting any intricate details or curves to fit within the limited 8x8 pixel space.
