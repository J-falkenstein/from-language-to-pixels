A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a percent sign can be created using an 8x8 pixel grid. The fundamental shape can be defined as a horizontal line that extends from the left side to the middle of the canvas, followed by a vertical line that extends downwards from the middle, and finally a curved line that connects the vertical line back to the starting point of the horizontal line. The horizontal line should be positioned in the middle of the canvas, vertically aligned with the 4th row. The vertical line should start from the midpoint of the horizontal line, and extend 2 pixels downwards. The curved line should start from the endpoint of the vertical line and curve slightly towards the middle of the horizontal line before connecting back to its starting point. The proportions and alignments should be maintained to ensure recognition, with the horizontal line taking up approximately the middle 4 pixels of the canvas, and the vertical line extending 2 pixels downwards from the middle of the horizontal line.
