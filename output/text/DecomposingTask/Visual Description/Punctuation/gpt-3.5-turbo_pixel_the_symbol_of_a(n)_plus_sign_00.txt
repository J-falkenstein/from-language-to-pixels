A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a plus sign in an 8x8 pixel artwork would consist of a central vertical line and a central horizontal line intersecting it. The vertical line should be 3 pixels long and positioned from the 3rd to the 5th pixel vertically. The horizontal line should be 3 pixels long and positioned from the 3rd to the 5th pixel horizontally. The lines should intersect at their central pixels. The remaining pixels can be left blank to maintain simplicity and clarity. This simplified representation captures the essential structure of the plus sign, allowing for easy recognition within the given constraints of size and space.
