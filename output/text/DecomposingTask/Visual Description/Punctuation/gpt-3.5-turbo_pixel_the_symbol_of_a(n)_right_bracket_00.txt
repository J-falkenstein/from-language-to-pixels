A simplified visual representation of a right bracket can be depicted as a rectangular shape with a vertical line on the left side. The rectangle should be about twice as tall as it is wide, with straight edges and right angles. The vertical line should be positioned on the left side, extending from the top to the bottom, and should be approximately two-thirds the height of the rectangle. This simple representation captures the essential features of the right bracket symbol, making it recognizable at an 8x8 pixel size.
