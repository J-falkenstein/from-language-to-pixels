A simplified visual representation of a right curly brace symbol can be created using an 8x8 pixel artwork. 

The fundamental shape of the right curly brace is a curved line bending towards the right. The line starts from the top left corner and curves downwards towards the bottom right corner. The curve is smooth and gradual, forming a shape similar to the letter "J" but with a longer tail. 

To emphasize recognition, the shape should be thickened to cover around 3-4 pixels horizontally and vertically. The thickness should be consistent throughout the curve. 

Proportions-wise, the length of the tail should take up approximately 6-7 pixels, with the remaining 1-2 pixels representing the starting point of the curve. 

The right end of the tail should align with the vertical axis of the pixel artwork, giving a sense of symmetry to the symbol. 

To create the simplified 8x8 pixel artwork, the curved line can be represented using a sequence of 1s (representing colored pixels) arranged as follows:

- The top-left corner pixel should be left blank (0).
- The pixel in the second row, second column should be a 1.
- The pixels in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rows should form a diagonal line slanting downwards towards the right (1 0 0 0 0 0 0).
- The pixel in the seventh row, seventh column should be a 1.
- The pixel in the eighth row, eighth column should be a 1.

This simplified representation captures the essential features of a right curly brace, focusing on the curved shape and its distinctive traits, while accounting for the limited space of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
