A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a right parenthesis in an 8x8 pixel artwork can be described as follows:

The right parenthesis symbol is represented by a vertically elongated shape resembling a curved bracket that leans towards the right side. The bracket starts at the top-left corner and curves downwards towards the bottom-right corner. The curvature is smooth and forms a wide arc, giving a rounded appearance to the symbol. The width of the arc is around 3-4 pixels, making it prominent within the 8x8 pixel canvas. The bottom-right corner of the symbol aligns with the bottom row of pixels and extends slightly beyond the right edge of the canvas. The upper-left corner of the symbol aligns with the upper row of pixels but leaves a gap of 1-2 pixels from the left edge of the canvas. The rest of the pixels within the 8x8 canvas remain empty, focusing solely on defining the shape of the right parenthesis symbol.
