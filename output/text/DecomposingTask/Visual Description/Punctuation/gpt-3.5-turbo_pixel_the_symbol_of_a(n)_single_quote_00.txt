A simplified visual representation of the symbol of a single quote in an 8x8 pixel artwork can be created as follows:

The symbol consists of a vertical line that is slightly curved towards the right. The height of the vertical line is equal to the height of 6 pixels, positioned in the middle of the 8x8 grid. The width of the line is 1 pixel. The top and bottom ends of the line are rounded, with a radius of 1 pixel.

To create the visual, start at the center of the 8x8 grid and draw a vertical line that spans from the third row to the sixth row, covering a total of 4 rows. The line should have rounded ends. For simplicity and space constraints, no additional angles, curves, or embellishments are included in this representation.

This simplified rendition of the symbol of a single quote emphasizes its basic shape and distinctive curving towards the right.
