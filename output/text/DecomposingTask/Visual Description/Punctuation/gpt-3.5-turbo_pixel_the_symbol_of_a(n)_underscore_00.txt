A simplified visual representation of the symbol of an underscore in an 8x8 pixel artwork would be a horizontal line spanning the width of the canvas. The line should be thin, with a consistent thickness throughout. It should be aligned in the middle of the canvas, occupying rows 4 and 5. The visual representation should emphasize simplicity and minimalism, omitting any unnecessary features or embellishments.
