A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a chess board can be created by using alternating black and white pixels arranged in a checkered pattern. The fundamental shape of the chessboard is a square, and it consists of 64 smaller squares. The distinctive traits of the chessboard include the regular pattern of alternating colors and the presence of a border around the entire board. The proportions of each individual square can be equal in size, occupying one pixel each in an 8x8 pixel artwork. The alignment and spatial relationships can be achieved by arranging the black and white pixels in a consistent pattern, starting with a black square in the top left corner and continuing with alternating colors horizontally and vertically.
