A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a car can be created by focusing on the essential features for recognition, while omitting intricate details. 

The fundamental shape of the car can be depicted by a rectangle measuring 5 pixels in width and 8 pixels in height. This rectangle represents the main body of the car. 

To emphasize the wheels, two smaller circles can be added at the bottom corners of the rectangle, each with a diameter of 2 pixels. These circles indicate the position of the car's wheels. 

For the car's distinctive traits, a small rectangle can be positioned on top of the main body, starting from the third pixel column and extending for 3 pixels. This rectangle represents the car's windshield.

Moreover, to signify the car's front, a triangle can be placed at the front end of the main body, taking up 3 pixels in width and 2 pixels in height. This triangle represents the car's bumper.

To further enhance the car's recognizable features, two small squares, each measuring 1 pixel in width and height, can be placed at the top corners of the main body. These squares represent the side mirrors of the car.

Lastly, to create spatial relationships and proportions, the wheels should be positioned at the bottom of the main body, the windshield on top of the body, and the bumper at the front end. The side mirrors should be placed symmetrically on both sides of the main body.

By following these guidelines, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a car can be created, which highlights the essential features necessary for recognition.
