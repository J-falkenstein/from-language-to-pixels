A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a cat could be as follows:

- The overall shape of the cat would resemble a rectangle, with a slightly rounded head on top and a tapered body at the bottom.
- The head would be positioned at the top of the rectangle, taking up approximately one-third of the vertical space. It would have two small dots for eyes in the center, spaced one pixel apart. Right below the eyes, there would be a curved line representing the nose, pointing downwards. Just below the nose, there would be a small horizontal line indicating the mouth.
- On either side of the head, there would be two pointy ears, each consisting of two diagonal lines.
- The body of the cat would take up the remaining two-thirds of the vertical space. It would consist of a slightly curved line connecting the bottom corners of the head, representing the back of the cat. Below the back, there would be a straight line representing the belly.
- For the legs, two diagonal lines would extend downwards from the bottom corners of the body, creating a V-shape for each leg. At the end of each leg, there would be a small horizontal line indicating the paw.
- Finally, a short curved line would extend from the bottom middle of the body, representing the tail.

By using this simplified 8x8 pixel representation, the basic shape of a cat can be recognized with essential features like the head, ears, body, legs, paws, and tail, while intricate details are omitted due to the limited space available.
