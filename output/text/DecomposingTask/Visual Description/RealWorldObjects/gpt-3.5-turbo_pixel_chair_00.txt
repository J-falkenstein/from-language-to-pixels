The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a chair would consist of a simple, recognizable shape that highlights the essential features of a chair. The chair will be depicted as a rectangular shape with a backrest and four legs.

In the 8x8 pixel artwork, the chair's backrest will be represented as a vertical line, occupying one pixel in the center of the top row. The seat will be represented by a horizontal line below the backrest, spanning the middle two rows.

For the legs, two vertical lines will be placed at the outer edge of the bottom row to depict the front legs. Similarly, two more vertical lines will be placed at the outer edge of the row above the bottom row to depict the back legs. 

The proportions of the chair will be simplified and represented within the constraints of the 8x8 pixel canvas, with equal spacing between the backrest and the legs, and the legs equally spaced from each other.

To summarize, the simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a chair would consist of a rectangular outline with a vertical line for the backrest, a horizontal line for the seat, and four vertical lines for the legs. The focus will be on capturing the essential elements of a chair while omitting intricate details.
