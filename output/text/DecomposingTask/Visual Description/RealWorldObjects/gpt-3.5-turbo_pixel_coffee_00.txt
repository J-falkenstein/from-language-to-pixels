In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation, the fundamental shape of coffee can be depicted as a slightly elongated, rounded rectangle. The top of the rectangle represents the coffee cup, while the bottom part signifies the coffee itself. To emphasize the distinct traits, a small handle can be shown on the left side of the cup. For additional recognition, a diagonal line can be drawn from the top right corner of the cup to the bottom right corner, representing the steam rising from the coffee. To maintain proportional accuracy, the width of the cup should be around 4 pixels, while the height can be around 6 pixels. The handle can take up 1 to 2 pixels in width, and the steam line can vary in thickness from 1 to 2 pixels, depending on the desired emphasis. Keep in mind that due to the limited space, intricate details such as saucers or elaborate designs may not be feasible.
