A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a cup can be created using the following arrangement:

- The cup can be represented by a simple rectangular shape, occupying the central 4x8 pixels of the grid. The top and bottom edges of the rectangle are straight and parallel to each other.
- At the top of the rectangle, the corners can be slightly rounded to represent the curvature of the cup's opening. These rounded corners can be created by altering the pixels at the top corners.
- Inside the rectangular shape, a smaller rectangle can be placed towards the bottom, representing the base of the cup. This rectangle should be centered horizontally and occupy around 2x8 pixels.
- To depict the handle, a small curve can be added on the right side of the cup. This curve can start from the top-right corner of the cup and extend towards the bottom-right corner, covering around 3x5 pixels.
- The handle curve should be placed slightly away from the cup's body to create clear separation.
- The handle curve should have a slight diagonal orientation to suggest its three-dimensional shape, with the top part of the curve extending a bit more towards the right than the bottom part.
- Due to the limited space, it may not be possible to represent any additional details like the saucer or intricate patterns on the cup.

Remember, this simplified representation focuses on the essential features for recognition, omitting intricate details to fit within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
