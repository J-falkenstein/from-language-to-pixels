A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a fly would consist of a small, dark-colored square positioned in the center of the 8x8 grid. This square would represent the body of the fly and should be the largest element. Additionally, two smaller squares, positioned vertically below the body square, can be added to represent the wings. These wing squares should be about half the size of the body square and aligned with the edges of the body square. Lastly, two tiny squares, placed horizontally on the upper part of the body square, indicate the eyes of the fly. These eye squares should be roughly a quarter of the size of the body square and positioned near its top edges.
