A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a key can be as follows:

- The key shape is represented by a vertically elongated rectangle, spanning across 3 pixels in width and 8 pixels in height.
- At the top of the rectangle, there is a small horizontal line of 2 pixels, creating the appearance of a handle.
- Inside the rectangular body, at the bottom, there is a small semi-circular shape, occupying 2 pixels in width and 1 pixel in height, representing the teeth of the key.
- The teeth are aligned centrally within the lower portion of the rectangle.
- The overall key shape is symmetric, with equal spacing of pixels on both sides of the handle and teeth.

This simplified representation captures the essence of a key, focusing on its rectangular body, handle, and tooth arrangement, while omitting intricate details.
