A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a lightning flash can be created by using a horizontal zigzag pattern. The lightning flash should be centered within the 8x8 grid. Here is a concise description of the key features:

1. The lightning flash starts at the top-left corner of the grid with a diagonal line aligned towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
2. This diagonal line occupies the first two rows and the first two columns of the grid.
3. From the end of the diagonal line, a horizontal line extends towards the right side of the grid for three pixels, occupying the third row.
4. From the end of the horizontal line, another diagonal line starts towards the bottom-right corner of the grid. This diagonal line should be aligned with the previous diagonal line, forming a vertical angle in the middle of the grid.
5. This second diagonal line occupies the fourth and fifth rows and the sixth and seventh columns of the grid.
6. Finally, from the end of the second diagonal line, a vertical line extends downwards for two pixels, occupying the sixth column of the grid.

By following these instructions, you will have a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a lightning flash that captures the essential features for recognition while omitting intricate details due to the limited space available.
