The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a mountain artwork would consist of basic shapes and lines to capture the essence of a mountain. It would be a triangular shape, with the peak at the center pixel (4th row, 4th column). The base of the mountain would span the middle two rows (3rd and 4th rows). The sides of the mountain would slope upwards diagonally towards the peak. The pixels on the sides of the mountain would gradually increase in intensity or darkness to depict shadows and depth.

To emphasize the mountain's ruggedness and jagged edges, the top few pixels of the peak and the sides of the mountain can be slightly uneven, forming small irregularities or peaks.

Alignment-wise, the peak pixel (4th row, 4th column) would serve as the central point of the mountain, and the rest of the pixels would align with it to maintain symmetry. The base of the mountain would be horizontally aligned with the peak.

The spatial relationship between pixels would create the illusion of distance and perspective. The pixels at the base would be wider apart, and as we move upward, the pixels would become closer together, giving a sense of height and distance.

This simplified representation would allow the viewer to recognize the artwork as a mountain despite the limited space and absence of intricate details.
