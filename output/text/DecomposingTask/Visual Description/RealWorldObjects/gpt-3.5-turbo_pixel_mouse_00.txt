A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a mouse can consist of the following features:

- The body of the mouse is represented by a square, occupying the central area of the 8x8 grid. The size of the square can be 4x4 pixels, placed in the middle of the grid.
- Towards the left side of the square, two small rectangles can be included to represent the mouse's ears. These rectangles can be 2 pixels tall and 1 pixel wide.
- To depict the mouse's eyes, two tiny dots can be placed above the ears, each consisting of a single pixel.
- The mouse's nose can be depicted as a small triangle, placed below the eyes. The triangle can be formed by 3 pixels, with the bottom two pixels forming the base and the top pixel representing the tip of the nose.
- For the mouse's tail, a short line consisting of 3 pixels can be placed towards the right side of the square, extending beyond the body of the mouse.
- The remaining pixels can be kept empty to represent the background or filled with a color of choice to add more visual interest.

In this simplified representation, proportions and alignments can be maintained by ensuring that the central square (mouse's body) is properly aligned within the 8x8 grid and the other features are placed relative to it. The ears, eyes, nose, and tail should be situated symmetrically and centered around the body to create a recognizable mouse-like shape.
