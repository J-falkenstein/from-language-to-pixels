A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a padlock can be displayed using a combination of black and white pixels. The fundamental shape of the padlock can be represented by a solid black square measuring 4x4 pixels. This square should be positioned centrally within the 8x8 pixel grid.

To create the shackle or U-shaped part of the lock, two vertical white lines measuring 1 pixel in width and 3 pixels in height should be drawn on the left and right sides of the black square, slightly below its center. These lines should be aligned with the edges of the central black square.

To emphasize the locking mechanism, a thin horizontal black line measuring 1 pixel in width should be drawn across the top of the black square, near its upper edge. Optionally, a small round black pixel can be placed at the center of this line to represent the keyhole.

By following these guidelines, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a padlock can be created, capturing its essential features and distinctive traits within the limited space available.
