In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a sad face, the fundamental shape would be a perfect circle. The circle would occupy the center of the grid, measuring 4x4 pixels. To depict the eyes, two small dots would be placed above the circle, aligned vertically and positioned symmetrically at the left and right edges of the circle. The mouth shape would be a simple, downward-curving line, positioned below the circle, also aligned horizontally along the center pixel row of the grid. The line would start at the left edge of the circle and end at the right edge. This representation would capture the main features of a sad face and enable recognition within the space constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
