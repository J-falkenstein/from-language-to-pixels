A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a stick figure can be created using a combination of straight lines and dots. The fundamental shape of the stick figure consists of a vertical line for the body and a horizontal line for the arms. The head is represented by a small circle placed on top of the vertical line. 

To depict the legs, two diagonal lines can be extending downwards from the bottom of the body. Additionally, small dots or short lines can be used to represent the hands and feet. 

To ensure recognition, it is important to maintain proper proportions and alignments. The vertical line for the body should be slightly longer than the horizontal line for the arms. The head should be placed on top of the body, and the legs should extend below the body.

By following these guidelines, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a stick figure can be created, emphasizing the essential features for recognition while omitting intricate details due to space constraints.
