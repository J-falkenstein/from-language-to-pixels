A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the sun can be created by using basic shapes and lines to convey its fundamental features. The sun can be represented as a perfect circle in the center of the 8x8 grid. The circle would fill the central 4x4 pixels, representing its approximately proportional size within the grid. 

To indicate the sun's rays, four straight lines would extend outward from the circle, starting at each of the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). These lines would extend to the edges of the grid, with a length of 2 pixels, to represent the simplified rays. The rays could also be slightly curved inwards to give a feeling of dynamism and energy. 

To represent the sun's face, two smaller circles can be placed inside the main circle to indicate eyes. These circles would be approximately 1 pixel in diameter and centered within the upper half of the main circle. Just below the eyes, a small semi-circular line can be drawn to represent a simplified smiling mouth. 

The colors used can be basic, such as a bright yellow for the sun's body and black for the eyes and mouth, to ensure clarity and visibility within the limited pixel space. The lines and circles should be bold enough to be easily identifiable.

In summary, the simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the sun would consist of a central 4x4 circular body, four 2-pixel lines extending as rays from the circle's cardinal directions, two small circles as eyes, and a simple semi-circular line as a smiling mouth.
