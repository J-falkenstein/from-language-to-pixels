The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a window would consist of a rectangular shape, typically taking up the middle 4x6 pixels of the available space. The top row and bottom row of the rectangle would be filled with a horizontal line to represent the window frame. The leftmost column and the rightmost column of the rectangle would also be filled with a vertical line to complete the frame. The remaining inner pixels of the rectangle would be left empty to indicate the glass pane of the window. This simplified representation would help recognize the window through its rectangular shape, horizontal and vertical lines for frame, and the absence of color or shading for the glass pane.
