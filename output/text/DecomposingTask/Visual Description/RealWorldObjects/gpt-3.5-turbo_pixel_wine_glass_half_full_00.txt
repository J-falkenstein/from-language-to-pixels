In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a wine glass half full, we can emphasize the essential features for recognition with the following description:

- The wine glass shape is represented by a vertical oval, occupying 4x8 pixels in the canvas.
- The top of the glass is curved and slightly wider than the bottom.
- Inside the glass, the wine is depicted as a curved arc, filling the bottom half of the glass.
- The arc starts from the left side of the glass and reaches the midpoint on the right side.
- The color of the wine is usually depicted as a darker shade than the glass, such as a deep red or purple.
- The glass should be distinguished from the background, either through color contrast or by using an outline to define its shape.
- The stem and base of the wine glass can be omitted due to space constraints, as they are not crucial for recognition in this simplified representation.

Please note that this simplified representation might lack intricate details and nuances. However, these essential features, proportions, alignments, and spatial relationships will allow for the recognition of a wine glass half full in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
