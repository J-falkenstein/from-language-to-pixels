The pixel matrix for a red number 2 would look like this:

[ (255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0) ]
