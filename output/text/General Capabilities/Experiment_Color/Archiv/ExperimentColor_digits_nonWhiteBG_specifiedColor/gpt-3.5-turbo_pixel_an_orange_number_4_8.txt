Unfortunately, without the actual pixel matrix, I cannot describe the specific colors and arrangement of the pixels to represent an orange number 4. However, the pixel matrix would consist of a grid of pixels, where each pixel contains RGB values representing the color. The colors would be chosen to create the appearance of an orange number 4, with a combination of red, green, and blue intensities.
