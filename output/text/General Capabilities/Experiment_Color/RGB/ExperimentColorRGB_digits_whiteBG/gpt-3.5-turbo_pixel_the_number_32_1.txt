Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I cannot process or display visual images directly. However, you can imagine a grid of pixels forming an image of the number 32 using the same representation as the examples provided above. Each pixel in the grid would have its corresponding RGB color values assigned to it, creating the desired image.
