Unfortunately, as an AI model, I am unable to see or visualize images. However, the pixel matrix representation would be similar to the examples provided above. Each pixel in the matrix would have specific RGB values, forming the shape of the number 4. The specific RGB values for each pixel would depend on the desired color and intensity of the number 4 in the image.
