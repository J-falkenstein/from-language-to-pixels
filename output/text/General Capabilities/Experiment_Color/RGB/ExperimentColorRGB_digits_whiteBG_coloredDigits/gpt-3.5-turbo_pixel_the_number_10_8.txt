Unfortunately, since I cannot generate images, I am unable to provide an example of a grid of pixels forming the number 10. However, you can imagine it as a combination of pixels arranged in a specific pattern to represent the number. Each pixel will have its corresponding RGB values to create the desired color. The pixel matrix for the number 10 would have a specific arrangement of pixels in the shape of the number, with each pixel containing its RGB color information.
