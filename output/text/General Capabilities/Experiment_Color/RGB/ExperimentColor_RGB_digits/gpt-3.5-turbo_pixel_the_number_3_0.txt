The example provided shows a representation of the number 3 using the pixel matrix method. Each pixel in the matrix is assigned a specific color value, represented by RGB values. In this case, the number 3 is shown in black (RGB values of 0,0,0) against a white background (RGB values of 255,255,255). The pixel matrix is an 8 by 8 grid, where each element represents a pixel and its associated RGB values.
