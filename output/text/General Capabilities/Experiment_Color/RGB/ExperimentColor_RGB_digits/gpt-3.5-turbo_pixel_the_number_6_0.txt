I apologize, but as a text-based AI, I cannot view or interpret images. However, based on the description you provided, the pixel matrix for the number 6 image would likely contain a combination of pixel values where the number 6 is represented by a certain arrangement of colored pixels, while the background is represented by another color or a combination of colors.
