Unfortunately, without a specific pixel matrix provided, I am unable to provide an example of a grid of pixels that form the capital letter D. However, the concept and representation of an image as a pixel matrix remains the same. Each pixel in the image would be assigned a specific RGB value, and these pixels would be arranged in a grid to form the desired shape or image.
