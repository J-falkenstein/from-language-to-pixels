Unfortunately, without the actual pixel values, I cannot provide an example of a grid of pixels forming the symbol of a dollar sign. However, you can imagine a grid of pixels where certain pixels are filled in a specific pattern to create the shape of a dollar sign. Each filled pixel would have its own RGB color value, while the unfilled pixels would have a background color (e.g., white or black).
