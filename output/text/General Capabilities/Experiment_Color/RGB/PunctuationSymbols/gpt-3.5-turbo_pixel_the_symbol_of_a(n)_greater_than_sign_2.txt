The representation of the greater than sign symbol may vary depending on the specific font or style used. Without a specific example, it is not possible to provide an accurate pixel matrix representation. However, it would generally involve a combination of pixels arranged in a specific pattern to form the shape of the symbol. Each pixel in the matrix would have its own RGB color values to create the desired appearance of the symbol.
