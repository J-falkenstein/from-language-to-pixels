I'm sorry, but I cannot generate an image here. However, an image of a chair would be represented by a grid of pixels, similar to the examples provided above. Each pixel in the grid would have RGB values corresponding to the color of that particular pixel. The exact arrangement of pixels would depend on the specific image of the chair being represented.
