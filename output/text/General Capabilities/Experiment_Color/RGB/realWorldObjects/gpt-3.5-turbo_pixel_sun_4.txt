Due to the limitations of text-based representation, it is not possible to accurately depict an image of a sun using a grid of pixels. However, imagine a grid of pixels where the central pixels form a bright yellow circle, representing the sun, and the surrounding pixels gradually transition from yellow to orange and then to dark blue or black, representing the sky. The exact arrangement and colors of the pixels would depend on the size and complexity of the image.
