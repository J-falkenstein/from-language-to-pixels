Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot directly display or generate images. However, I can provide a description of how the image of a wine glass half full could be represented as a grid of pixels.

Assuming the image has a resolution of 10 by 10 pixels, the pixel matrix could look something like this:

[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

In this representation, the wine glass is composed of blue pixels (0, 0, 255), while the areas outside the glass are represented by white pixels (255, 255, 255). The black pixels (0, 0, 0) represent the areas where the wine is present in the glass.

Please note that this is just one possible representation, and the actual pixel matrix would depend on the specific image and its resolution.
