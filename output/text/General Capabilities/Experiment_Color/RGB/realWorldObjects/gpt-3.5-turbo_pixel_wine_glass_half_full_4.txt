I'm sorry, but as a language model AI, I am unable to generate or display images. However, I can provide you with a verbal description of the image you mentioned.

A wine glass half full can be represented by a grid of pixels where the top half of the glass is filled with a certain color, such as red, and the bottom half is left empty or transparent. The specific RGB values of the pixels would depend on the color and shading used in the image.
