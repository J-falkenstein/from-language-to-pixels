Given the constraints of this text-based medium, it's impossible to provide an accurate representation of the number 10. However, we can give a simplified representation like the examples above, using a 8x8 pixel matrix. Each pixel is represented either as black (0, 0, 0) or white (255, 255, 255). For a more accurate representation, a more detailed and larger pixel matrix would be needed.

Here, the top four rows roughly form the number "1", and the bottom four rows form "0".
