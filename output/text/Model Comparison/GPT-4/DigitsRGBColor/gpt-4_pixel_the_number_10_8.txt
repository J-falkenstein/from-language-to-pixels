As an AI model, I'm unable to generate visual content. However, I can describe how it would look in pixel form. The number "10" would consist of two separate parts: "1" and "0". The "1" could be formed by a vertical line of black pixels in the grid, and the "0" could be formed by a circle of black pixels. The background would typically be white or another contrasting color.
