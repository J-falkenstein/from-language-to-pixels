Given the limitations of text representation, the following is a basic, simplified representation of a 32x32 pixel grid for the number 32. Note that the number is represented in black and the background is white. Each entry corresponds to a pixel, where '0' represents a black pixel and '255' represents a white pixel.

```
[255, 255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255]
...
(repeated 32 times)
...
```

Here, the "..." indicate the repeated lines for simplicity. This grid only represents the intensity of a grayscale image. The actual number "32" graphic representation would require advanced programming and formatting. If we were to show the entire pixel grid, it would be too large for a text-based format. 

Remember, in a realistic RGB image, every single pixel would be represented with a tuple of three intensity values (one for each of the red, green, and blue channels). For example, a black pixel would be represented as (0, 0, 0) and a white pixel would be represented as (255, 255, 255).

This pixel matrix is a simplified and scaled down version of how real digital images are stored and processed within computers and digital devices. The actual process is complex and involves significant data handling, digital processing, and memory allocation.
