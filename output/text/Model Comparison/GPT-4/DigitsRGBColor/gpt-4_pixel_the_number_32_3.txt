Due to the limitations of text formatting, it's quite challenging to precisely depict a graphical representation of the number 32 using a pixel matrix in text form. However, here's a simplified example using a 2x3 pixel matrix for each digit, with '0' representing white and '1' representing black:

Number 3:
[ (1, 1)(0, 1) ]
[ (1, 1)(1, 0) ]
[ (1, 1)(0, 1) ]

Number 2:
[ (1, 1)(0, 1) ]
[ (0, 1)(1, 1) ]
[ (1, 0)(1, 1) ]

Please note that an actual image would have a much larger pixel matrix and use RGB values to depict colors. Additionally, it's important to mention that the depiction of numbers (or any other shapes or objects) in an image greatly depends on the resolution or the number of pixels used to represent it. The more pixels you use, the more accurately and detailedly you can depict the object.
