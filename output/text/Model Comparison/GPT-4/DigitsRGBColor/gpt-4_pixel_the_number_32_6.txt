Due to the limitations of text format, it's a challenging task to create an exact representation of a number 32 using a pixel matrix. However, an attempt to represent a rough approximation of the number 32 might look something like this:

For simplicity, let's use a 16x16 grid, with '1' representing a black pixel and '0' a white pixel:

[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
And so on...

The above is an incomplete and simplistic representation. In real digital images, the pixel matrix would be much larger and the pixel color information would be represented by RGB values rather than simple black and white. Also, creating a clear representation of a '32' would likely require a larger matrix.
