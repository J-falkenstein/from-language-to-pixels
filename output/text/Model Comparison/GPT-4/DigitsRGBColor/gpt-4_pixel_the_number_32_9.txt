Due to the limitations of text, it's challenging to demonstrate this example accurately. However, in principle, it would simply be a matter of arranging the values of the pixel matrix to create an image of the number 32. The pixel matrix would still follow the RGB color model as explained earlier, with each pixel represented by a combination of red, green, and blue intensity values. 

The number "3" could be represented in one color (for example, red, with RGB values (255, 0, 0)) on a contrasting background (like white, with RGB values (255,255,255)). The number "2" could be represented similarly, but perhaps shifted appropriately to the right to appear next to the "3" in the image. 

Creating this kind of image would involve a detailed knowledge of pixel arrays and likely the use of specialized software. This explanation is a reduction of the complexity involved in image processing and digital art creation.
