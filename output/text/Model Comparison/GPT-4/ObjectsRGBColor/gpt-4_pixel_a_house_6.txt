Creating an image of a house using RGB values can be quite complex as it requires vast pixel details. However, let's consider a 5x5 pixel grid, where (0,0,0) is black and (255,255,255) is white, (255,0,0) is red, (0,255,0) is green, and (0,0,255) is blue.

Here's a simple abstract representation of a house:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255, 255, 255) ]

The black pixel (0, 0, 0) in the middle of the top row represents the point of the roof, the black pixels (0, 0, 0) in the remaining rows represent the walls of the house, and the white pixels (255, 255, 255) are the empty spaces. This is, of course, a very abstract and simple representation, as real images are composed of millions of pixels.
