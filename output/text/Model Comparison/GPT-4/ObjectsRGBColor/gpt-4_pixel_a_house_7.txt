Sorry, due to the text limitation, I cannot represent complex objects like a house in pixel matrix form. However, the pixel matrix for a house would have many different colors and shapes, dependent on the color, size, and style of the house, as well as the background. Remember, each pixel would be represented by an RGB value to form the full image. 

An abstract, simplified black-and-white version of a house might look something like this: 

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

This example is highly abstract and simplified, and an actual image would contain many more pixels and colors.
