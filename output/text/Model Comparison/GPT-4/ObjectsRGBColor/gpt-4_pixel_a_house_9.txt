Due to the limitations of text representation, it is not feasible to accurately represent an image of a house using a pixel grid. However, we can simplify this by creating a representation of a house using 1's to represent black pixels and 0's to represent white pixels.

Here's a simple example of a 10x10 pixel representation of a house:

[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(1,1,1)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]
[ (0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0) ]

Please note that in real-world applications, images are typically composed of thousands to millions of pixels, and can have a much more complex color composition.
