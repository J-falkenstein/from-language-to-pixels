Unfortunately, given the text-based medium and limitations of character count, it's not feasible to provide a pixel grid representation of a complex image like a boat. Pixel grids provided here as examples are highly simplified, and real images like a boat will have tens of thousands to millions of pixels, each with unique RGB values. Rendered in text, it would be unreadable. 

However, the representation would still follow the same rules. Each pixel would have a corresponding RGB value, creating the colors of the boat and its surroundings. The array of these values would form a matrix mathematically describing the boat image.

In order to view pixel details of a complex image like a boat, you would need to use image processing software that can zoom in to individual pixels and display their color values.
