As an AI model, I am not able to create visual images. However, I can provide an abstract representation. If "1" represents a black pixel and "0" represents a white pixel, a super simplified pixel matrix could look something like this:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The actual pixel matrices for digital images are much more complex and large since they include color information as well. They are usually composed of three color channels (Red, Green, Blue) each containing hundreds of rows and columns of data depending on the resolution of the image.
