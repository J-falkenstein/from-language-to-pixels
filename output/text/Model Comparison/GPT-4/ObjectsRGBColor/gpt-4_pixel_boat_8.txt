The complexity of a boat image would typically require a much larger pixel matrix than is feasible to illustrate as text. Even a simple silhouette of a boat would be too complex to represent at a resolution as low as 8x8 pixels. If we would attempt to recreate the silhouette of a simple boat at such a low resolution, it would not be recognizable in most cases.

In digital imaging practice, a full colored image of a boat would consist of millions of pixel data points in a matrix, with each pixel storing a unique RGB color code. To give a rough idea, here is an 8x8 pixel matrix depicting a highly simplified and abstracted boat, where the "1" represents a black pixel and the "0" represents a white pixel:

```
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]  
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]  
```
Please note that this is a very highly simplified example, and the boat image in practical applications would be much more complicated and would not be easily represented in this format.
