Due to the complexity of real-world images, representing a boat in an 8x8 pixel matrix would not result in a recognizable image. However, consider a simplified, abstract image of a boat as a series of red pixels (represented as (255, 0, 0)) surrounded by blue pixels (represented as (0, 0, 255)) to represent water.

[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]

This grid represents a very simplified and abstracted boat and water scenario, with red representing the boat and blue representing the water. In a real-world application, the pixel matrix would be much larger and contain a far greater range of color values to accurately represent the image.
