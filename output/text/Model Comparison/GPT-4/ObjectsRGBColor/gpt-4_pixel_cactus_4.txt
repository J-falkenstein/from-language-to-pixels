Note: The exact representation of a complex image such as a cactus image would require a large pixel matrix and cannot be accurately represented in text. However, a simplified version could look something like this:

[
  (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0), (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255), (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0)
  (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0), (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255), (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0)
  (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255), (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0), (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255)
  (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255), (0, 128, 0), (0, 128, 0), (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255)
] 

Here, a green (0, 128, 0) pixel represents a part of the cactus and a white (255, 255, 255) pixel represents the background.

This is a very simplified representation and an actual cactus image would have a significantly larger pixel matrix with a wide array of colors for detailing.
