Representing a complex image like a cactus is beyond the scope of the text-based pixel grids, as they can only represent very simple shapes in a few colors. However, to give you a basic idea, imagine that each (R, G, B) triplet is a pixel in the cactus image. Each pixel is colored based on the RGB value and arranged in a matrix according to the dimensions of the image.

In real applications, these matrices can be quite large. For example, a 1024x768 pixel image has a matrix of 1024 rows and 768 columns. Each entry in the matrix is an RGB triplet representing the color of the respective pixel.

To analyze or process the image, computer programs iterate over this matrix and perform computations on the RGB values. This can include tasks like adjusting brightness and contrast, applying filters, detecting edges, etc.
