As a text-based AI, I'm unable to generate visual content. However, I can describe how an image of a car might be represented in a pixel matrix form. 

Imagine a simplified 8x8 pixel image of a car. The car is red (255, 0, 0) on a white (255, 255, 255) background. The car might be shaped like a rectangle with a smaller rectangle on top to represent the car cabin. It's important to remember that an 8x8 pixel image will be very basic and pixelated. In real applications, images are made of thousands or millions of pixels, allowing for a great level of detail. 

Here's how part of the matrix might look:

```
[ (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) (255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ]
...
```

Each (255, 0, 0) represents a pixel of the car and each (255, 255, 255) represents a pixel of the white background.
