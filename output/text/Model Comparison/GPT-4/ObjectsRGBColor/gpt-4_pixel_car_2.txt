As an AI text model, I am currently unable to generate a full-fledged visual representation of a complex image like a car using a grid of pixels. However, I can give you a very basic conceptual understanding of how it would look by using a pixel matrix. 

Let's consider an extremely simplified version where we have a 10 by 5 pixel matrix. As an approximation:

- (0, 0, 0) represents black (the car)
- (255, 255, 255) represents white (the background)

```
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
```

In the above representation, a simple car shape is depicted. This is oversimplified and real images would involve much larger matrices with a range of colors for detailed representation.
