Apologies for any confusion, but it's not feasible to represent a detailed image like a car in an 8x8 pixel matrix. Showing an image of a car would require many more pixels for any meaningful visual representation. The examples provided above are simple numerical digits that are relatively easy to depict in a limited pixel matrix. A car image would require a much larger pixel matrix and hence cannot be easily illustrated in this text format. It's also important to note that in practice, pixel matrices for images are dealt with programmatically using image processing software and libraries, not manually.
