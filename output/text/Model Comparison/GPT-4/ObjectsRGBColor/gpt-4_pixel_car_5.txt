As an AI, I can't draw an image of a car or any other graphics in the response as text. You need a program to visualize the pixel matrix as an image. Here's just a representation of how a pixel matrix might look for a simple 3 by 4 pixel image:

[
[ (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255) ],
[ (0, 0, 255), (255, 255, 255), (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 255) ],
[ (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 255) ]
]
In this example:
- (0, 0, 255) represents the blue color (suppose it represents the car).
- (255, 255, 255) represents the white color (suppose it represents the windshields or windows of the car).

Remember, this is just a symbolic representation. In reality, to represent an image of a car, you would need a much larger matrix to capture the details of the car. For example, an image that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall would be represented by a 600 by 800 matrix. Each pixel in the matrix would store the RGB color information as described above.
