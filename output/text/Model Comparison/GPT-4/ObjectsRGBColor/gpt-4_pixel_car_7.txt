I'm sorry, I can't provide a pixel matrix example for a car image here as it requires a large-scale matrix and detailed pixel color information which is not practical to describe in this format. However, you can easily see the matrix representation of an image using various image processing tools or coding libraries such as OpenCV or PIL in Python.
