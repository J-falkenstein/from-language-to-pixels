Creating an example of a car using pixel matrices would be very complex and beyond the scope of a simple text explanation due to the level of detail involved. This would require a complicated array with thousands, or even millions, of color combinations. However, here is a very simplified example of a car made up with 8x3 pixelated image:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]

This represents a very simplified red car against a white background. The top line represents the roof, the middle the body of the car in red, and the bottom line representing the wheels in black. Remember this is a vast simplification, real images would have a far larger and more detailed array of pixels.
