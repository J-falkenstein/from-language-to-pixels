As a text-based AI, I am not able to demonstrate a pixel matrix that represents an image of a cat. 

However, you can imagine a complex grid of small squares (pixels), each containing a different combination of red, green, and blue values. Together, these pixels form a coherent image of a cat when viewed from a distance. This image would include a variety of colors to represent different parts of the cat (e.g., fur, eyes, nose) and its surroundings.

In actual practice, image matrices for something as complex as a cat would involve hundreds or even thousands of pixels in each dimension. It would be virtually impossible to accurately represent such a matrix in a text-based format. 

Most computer and image processing software provide visual tools to view or manipulate pixel matrices. Likewise, programming languages used for image processing, such as Python with libraries like PIL or OpenCV, can be used to work with pixel data programmatically.
