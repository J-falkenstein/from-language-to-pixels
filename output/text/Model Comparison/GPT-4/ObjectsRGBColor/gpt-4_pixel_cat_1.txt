The explanation of how to represent an image as pixel matrices in this text is quite detailed and hence it's not practically feasible to depict a complex image like a cat in this format. You would require a large matrix with each pixel code representing each specific color. Even a small image of a cat would require hundreds of lines of RGB codes.

For example, the pixel at the top left corner of the image might be something like (120, 80, 200) representing a specific shade of purple, the next pixel could be (130, 85, 210) representing a slightly different shade, and so on across the entire image. With modern image resolutions, this would add up to millions or even billions of pixels. 

For simplicity, this text has used 8x8 matrix to represent simple shapes such as numbers. In a real application, the representation would be much more complex.
