Unfortunately, pixel matrices are complex and can't be accurately represented in plain text. They usually contain thousands or even millions of pixels, each storing a numeric value to represent color. For example, an image of a cat may contain varying shades of browns, whites, blacks, and other colors and hence, would require a large complex matrix to represent it accurately. 

In practical applications, Python or other programming languages are usually used to interpret image files into a form that we can manipulate and analyze, such as matrices and arrays. If you're interested in seeing a representation of a cat image in pixel data, you would need to use a programming language with libraries for handling images, such as Python's Pillow or OpenCV.

The point of the examples above was to demonstrate how images can be translated into numerical representations, and that each pixel corresponds to a specific color through its RGB value.
