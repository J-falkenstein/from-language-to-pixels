As an AI, I'm unable to draw a picture. However, I can describe a simplified example:

Assume, the image is an 8x8 pixel art of a cat face.

The "cat" pixel matrix might look like this:

[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]

Here, (0, 0, 0) represents black (the background), and (255, 255, 255) represents white (the cat face). The design is a very simplified depiction of a cat face, with two ears formed in the top row, two eyes in the second and third rows, a small nose in the fourth row, whiskers and mouth in the fifth and sixth rows.
