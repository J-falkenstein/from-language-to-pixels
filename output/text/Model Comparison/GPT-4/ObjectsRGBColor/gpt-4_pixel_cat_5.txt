For simplicity and readability, letâ€™s represent a simple 8 by 8 pixel image of a cat where each pixel is represented as a single character: 'X' for black and '-' for white.

```
[ '---------X-----' ]
[ '-------XXXX----' ]
[ '------XX--XX---' ]
[ '------X----X---' ]
[ '-----XX----X---' ]
[ '----X---XX-----' ]
[ '---X--X--------' ]
[ '--X-X----------' ]
```

In this simple representation, the 'X' characters form the shape of a cat.

In a real image, every 'X' and '-' would be a pixel and have an RGB color based on color depth, for example (0, 0, 0) for black and (255, 255, 255) for white in an 8-bit RGB image. More complex images would also have more shades and colors.
