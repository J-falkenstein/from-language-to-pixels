As an AI text-based model, I can't produce visual content, including images or a grid representation of an image with pixels. The representation of a matrix of a "cat" image would be extremely complex and lengthy due to the vast number of colors and resolutions that a standard image contains. It usually involves hundreds of thousands to millions of pixels. However, here's a simplified representation of what an image of a cat might look like in a 3x3 pixel grid, where "B" represents blue, "G" represents grey, and "W" represents white pixels:

[ (B,B,B),
  (B,G,B),
  (W,G,W) ]

Please note that real-life images would contain many more pixels and colors. In fact, a 3x3 pixel image would not resemble anything discernible to the human eye. The above representation is just an oversimplified example for a better understanding of the concept.
