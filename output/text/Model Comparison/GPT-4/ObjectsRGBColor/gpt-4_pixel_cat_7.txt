Sorry, it is hard to depict a complex image like a cat using text-based RGB values. To create a detailed visual representation such as a cat, a much larger pixel matrix with a vast variety of RGB values is required. This complexity is beyond the scope of text-based representation. However, you can imagine a large grid with each cell containing an RGB value, which collectively forms the picture of a cat.
