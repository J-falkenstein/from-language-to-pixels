As the assistant AI, I'm unable to draw, but I can describe it in word form.

A pixel grid that forms an image of a cat might feature a collection of pixels with various shades of grey, black, and white (if it's a grayscale image), or various shades of many other colors (if it's a color image).

Assuming the cat's fur is black and white, and the image forms a close-up view of the cat's face, you can imagine a collection of mostly black pixels forming the outline of the cat's eyes, nose, mouth, and fur. The cat's eyes might be a bright green or blue, represented by pixels with RGB values that correspond to those colors. The white areas of the cat's fur would be represented by pixels with RGB values of (255, 255, 255), while the black areas would be pixels with RGB values of (0, 0, 0). 

If the image is more complicated - for instance, if the cat is sitting in a grassy field under a blue sky - there will be many more colors involved. The grass might be represented by a mix of different shades of green pixels, while the sky would be a mix of different shades of blue pixels.

Remember that real images would be made up of millions of pixels - the more pixels, the more detailed the image can be. Thus, a simple 8 by 8 or 16 by 16 grid could only represent a very crude, blocky image of a cat.
