Due to the complexity and size of the pixel array of a chair and the text-only format of this platform, it's not possible to provide a visual representation here. However, an image of a chair would be represented by a larger and more intricately arranged matrix of pixels, each holding a specific RGB value that, when viewed from a distance, forms the picture of a chair.
