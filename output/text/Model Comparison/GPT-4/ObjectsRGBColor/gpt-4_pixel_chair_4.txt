Due to the limitation in expressing visual data in text, I'll describe a simple black and white (8x8 pixels) representation of a chair:

[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]

[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]

This pixel matrix represents an image of a simple chair from a side view, where black pixels (0,0,0) depict the chair and white pixels (255,255,255) depict the background. Note that this is an overly simplified representation and actual images would have much greater resolution and usually contain colors.
