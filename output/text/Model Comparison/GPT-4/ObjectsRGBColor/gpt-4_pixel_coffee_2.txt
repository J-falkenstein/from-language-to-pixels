Given the complexity of a coffee image, it would require a large matrix of pixels to accurately represent it, which would be impractical to show in text form. Usually, such complex images are handled with computer software, which can store and interpret the vast amount of pixel data accurately.

However, here is a simplified 5x5 pixel representation of a coffee mug on a white background:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 102, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 102, 0)(255, 102, 0)(255, 102, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 102, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

Here, (0, 0, 0) represents black outlining the mug, (255, 102, 0) symbolizes the brown color of the coffee, and (255, 255, 255) represents the white background. This example greatly simplifies the complexities of an actual coffee image, which would contain a much larger array of pixel colors and resolutions.
