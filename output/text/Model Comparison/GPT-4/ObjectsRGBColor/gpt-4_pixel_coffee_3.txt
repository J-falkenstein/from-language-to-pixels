I'm sorry for the confusion, but it's not currently feasible to depict an image of a coffee or any complex image through text-based RGB representations. An image of a coffee would contain thousands to millions of unique color values, and it would be incredibly complex to represent visually using text only. The prior examples of numbers are vastly simplified and minimized for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario, images are stored as binary information in image files and rendered by software capable of interpreting that data, such as photo viewers or web browsers.
