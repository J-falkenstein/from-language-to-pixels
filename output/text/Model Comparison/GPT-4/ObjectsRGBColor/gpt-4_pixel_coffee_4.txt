Your request seems to indicate that you want a representation of an image of a coffee in terms of a grid of pixels. However, expressing an image of something complex like a coffee, in terms of pixel data in plain text would result in a huge matrix of RGB values that wouldn't clearly depict a meaningful picture or be easy to interpret.

Additionally, without the actual image and its pixel data, it's not possible to generate an accurate matrix. Because of these reasons, we can't give you an example in this format. 

However, to give you an idea, just like the example images of numbers above, an image, such as a simple coffee cup, could be represented as a large matrix (2D array) of RGB values where each RGB value represents the color of a specific pixel in the image. Complex images might have tens of thousands or even millions of these individual pixels.
