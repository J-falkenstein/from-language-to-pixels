As an AI, I'm currently unable to showcase the visual representation of a coffee image in the form of a grid of pixels. The examples provided above for numbers are quite simplified with their 8 by 8 pixel matrix. Real photos, like that of a coffee, would often consist of millions of pixels in real-world applications, and the color information contained in each pixel would vary significantly, not just black, white, or single RGB colors.

In theory, however, each pixel of a coffee image would be represented by an RGB value. The range of RGB values would capture all the different shades and nuances of the image, such as the deep brown of the coffee, the white of the mug, the shadows and highlights, and the background colors. Each pixel would therefore be a data point representing the color at that specific point in the image. 

When all these pixels are viewed together, our eyes process this color and positional data to form a coherent image of a coffee cup.
