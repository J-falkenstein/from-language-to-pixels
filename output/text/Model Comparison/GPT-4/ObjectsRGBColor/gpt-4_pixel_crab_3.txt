Due to the complexity of illustrations, it's not possible to provide an example of a pixel matrix for a complex image like a crab in plain text. It would take millions of pixels to accurately depict a crab, and each one would have a different color composition.

However, below is a simplified, abstract idea of how a 8x8 pixel matrix of a crab might vaguely look, using the concept of ASCII art where "(0, 0, 0)" represents a black pixel and "(255, 255, 255)" represents a white pixel:

[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]
[(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)]
[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]

Note that real digital images usually contain much more detailed color data, and use color combinations other than pure black and white. To represent a real digital image of a crab, we would need a much larger pixel matrix, far more color variety, and much finer distinctions between pixel color values.
