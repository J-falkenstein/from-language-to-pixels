A pixel matrix for a complex image like a crab would be quite large and difficult to represent in text format. It would involve a grid of RGB values for each pixel making up the image, representing a wide range of colors and shades. However, here's a simplistic and hypothetical 5x5 example for illustration:

[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(255, 0, 0)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]

In this example, the (255, 0, 0) pixels might represent the crab, while the (0, 0, 255) pixels represent the water. This is, of course, a very simplified example. A real-world pixel matrix for an image of a crab would be much larger and contain a wide range of RGB values to accurately represent the many colors and shades in the image.
