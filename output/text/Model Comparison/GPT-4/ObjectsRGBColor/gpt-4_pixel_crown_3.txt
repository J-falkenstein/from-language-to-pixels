Creating a visual image using text representation can be a bit challenging and the following pixel representation may not perfectly capture the intricacies of a crown, but here's a simple attempt.
I'll represent a pixel in black (0, 0, 0) as "B" and a pixel in yellow (255, 255, 0) as "Y" for convenience:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
-> [     W             W            B           Y            B            Y            B           W            W     ]

[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
-> [    W             B             Y            B             Y            B            Y            B           W       ]

[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
-> [ B            Y             B              W             B            W             B            Y             B     ]

[ (255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0) ]
-> [ Y            B             Y              B            Y              B            Y            B            Y     ]

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
-> [    W              Y             B             Y            B             Y            B            Y           W      ]

In ASCII Art it would look like:

WWBYBYBWW
WYBYBYBYW
BYBWBYBYB
YBYBYBYBY
WYBYBYBYW

This would represent a simple crown-like image, where each "Y" (yellow) represents the parts of the crown and each "B" (black) represents the emblems on the crown. The "W" (white) represents the background.
