Without specific RGB values for each pixel, it's impossible to provide an example accurately. Indeed, I don't know what colors the crown is, what the background color is, and what the resolution of the image is. 

However, conceptually, the representation would be a matrix (2D array) where each entry is a tuple of RGB values. The size of this matrix would depend on the resolution of the image. For instance, an 8x8 pixel image would be represented by an 8x8 matrix.

Here is a hypothetical 3x3 matrix representing a very simplistic, low-resolution image of a crown:

[ (255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 255, 0)(255, 255, 0)(255, 255, 0) ]

In this simple and abstract example, (255, 255, 0) might represent yellow (the color of the crown) and (0, 0, 0) might represent black (the background color). Note that in a real situation, the image would use far more than 9 pixels, allowing for much finer detail.
