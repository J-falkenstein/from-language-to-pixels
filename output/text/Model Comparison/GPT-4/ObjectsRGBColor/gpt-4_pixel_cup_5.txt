Here, due to the text-based interface, we are unable to display a cup image. But similar to the examples above, an image of a cup would be represented as a matrix of pixels each with RGB triplet encoding the color information. You would likely see a variety of RGB values representing different colors and shades in the cup image. For instance, if the cup is red, you should see more pixels with high red intensity values (R close to 255 in the RGB triplet), and the background, depending upon its color, would have a different set of RGB values.
