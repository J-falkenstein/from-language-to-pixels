Since a cup would require a more complex pixel matrix, a general idea would be:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]

Here, the cup is represented by the black pixels, while the white pixels represent the background. 

Please note that this is a highly simplified example, and a real image of a cup would involve many more pixels, a wide range of colors and a much bigger matrix to achieve a high level of detail.
