Here's an 8x8 pixel grid representation of a simplified cup image. To keep this simple, let's use three colors: white `(255, 255, 255)` for the background, black `(0, 0, 0)` for the cup, and yellow `(255, 255, 0)` for the handle.

Please note that this image is highly simplified due to the limitation in pixel size.
