Creating a pixel matrix for a complex image like a fly will result in a large amount of data and is not practical to demonstrate here. However, I can explain how it would look in theory.

The fly image would be represented as a grid where each cell in the grid would represent a pixel and contains the RGB values of that pixel. The RGB value would be represented as a tuple, like (R, G, B), where R/G/B are integers from 0 to 255 that represent the intensity of red, green, and blue color respectively.

For example:

[ (150, 150, 150)(120, 120, 120)(100, 100, 100)... ]
[ (130, 130, 130)(110, 110, 110)(90, 90, 90) ... ]
[ (120, 120, 120)(100, 100, 100)(80, 80, 80) ... ]
...

In this example, darker RGB values (closer to (0, 0, 0)) could represent the fly itself, while lighter values ( closer to (255, 255, 255)) could represent the background. The actual values would depend on the specific colors and details of the fly and the image itself.
