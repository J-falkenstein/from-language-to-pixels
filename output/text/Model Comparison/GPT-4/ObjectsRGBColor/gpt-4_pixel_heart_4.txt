Due to the limitations of text formatting, it's impractical to draw a heart shape with pixel matrix here. However, the concept is the same: a grid of pixels where each pixel (or point) is represented by an RGB value. A black pixel might be represented by (0, 0, 0), and a red pixel by (255, 0, 0). By arranging these pixels in a specific order, an image of a heart could be created.

In practice, you'd use software to create an image like this, as the number of pixels in even a small image would be in the thousands or tens of thousands, and each pixel's RGB value would be set individually. In a digital image, the software creates a matrix (or grid) of these pixels, each pixel with a specific RGB value, to form the final image. 

For instance, pixels in the shape of a heart could have a different RGB value (like red for (255, 0, 0)) from the rest of the pixels (like white for (255, 255, 255)), creating a red heart on a white background.
