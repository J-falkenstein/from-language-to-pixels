The image key serves as a legend or guide to interpret the pixel matrix or grid in the context of the image. For example, in an image of a black number six on a blue background, "0, 0, 0" represents the color black used to form the number six, while "0, 0, 255" represents the blue background color. It helps to understand the coding of pixel colors and their corresponding representation in the image.
