I'm sorry, I can't provide the example of a lightning flash image in text format. However, an image of a lightning flash would be represented by a matrix of pixels, where each pixel contains a combination of red, green, and blue color values that together create the color of that pixel. The pixels that make up the lightning would generally have higher values in all three color channel (closer to white) compare to the surrounding pixels, which would be darker (closer to black or the color of the night sky).
