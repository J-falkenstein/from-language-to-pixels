We can't represent an image of a mountain in text form as it would require a huge matrix of RGB values to represent the complex visual information. However, if we simplify it to a very low resolution using just two colors (black for the mountain and white for the background), it may look something like this:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]

Please note that because of the low resolution, the interpretation of the "image" as a mountain can be very abstract and heavily simplified.
