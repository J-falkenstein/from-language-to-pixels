Creating a pixel representation of a complex image like a mountain is beyond the scope of a text-based response, as it would require thousands or millions of RGB values and would not be readable. However, to give you an idea, a simplistic pixel representation of a mountain-scenery may look something like this:

[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ] # Blue sky
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ] # Blue sky
[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(128, 128, 128)(128, 128, 128)(128, 128, 128)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ] # Gray mountain against blue sky
[ (0, 0, 255)(128, 128, 128)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(128, 128, 128)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ] # Gray mountain with green trees
[ (128, 128, 128)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(128, 128, 128)(0, 0, 255) ] # Green ground with trees
[ (50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50) ] # Green ground with trees
[ (50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50) ] # Green ground with trees
[ (50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50)(50, 205, 50) ] # Green ground with trees

In this model, (0, 0, 255) is a blue pixel (representing the sky), (128, 128, 128) is a gray pixel (representing the mountain), and (50, 205, 50) is a green pixel (representing trees and ground). The image is greatly simplified and abstracted, as real-world images would contain far more nuanced color variations and far more pixels.
