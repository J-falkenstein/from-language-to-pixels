Representing a complex image like a mountain requires a detailed pixel matrix that is far larger than 8x8. This matrix would contain varied RGB values to represent the different colors and gradients present in the image. The pixel matrix for a complex image like a mountain would typically have dimensions in the range of several thousand pixels in width and height. For the sake of simplicity, let's consider a simplified, abstract example of a 6x6 pixel "mountain" composed primarily of blues, greens, and browns:

[ (0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255)(128, 128, 128)(128, 128, 128)(0, 0, 255)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 255)(128, 128, 128)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(128, 128, 128)(0, 0, 255) ]
[ (128, 128, 128)(85, 107, 47)(139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19)(85, 107, 47)(128, 128, 128) ]
[ (85, 107, 47)(139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19)(85, 107, 47) ]
[ (139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(139, 69, 19)(139, 69, 19) ]
[ (85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47)(85, 107, 47) ]

In this pixel matrix representation, (0, 0, 255) represents the color blue (sky), (128, 128, 128) represents grey (clouds), (85, 107, 47) represents a dark green color (trees), and (139, 69, 19) represents a brown color (mountain). Please note, this is a very simplified and abstract representation. Real images would have a much higher pixel density and better color variety and gradients.
