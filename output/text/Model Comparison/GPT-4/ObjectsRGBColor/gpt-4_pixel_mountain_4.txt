Due to the complexity and high resolution of a real-world image like a mountain, it's not practical to represent it as a pixel matrix in text form because it would require a huge amount of data. However, at a conceptual level, it would be a three-dimensional array (width, height, color channels) where each pixel has an RGB value representing its color. 

It's important to note that the pixel values for a natural scene like a mountain landscape would vary widely across the image, representing different colors and intensities according to the details of the scene (e.g., the sky, mountain peaks, trees, etc.). Each one of these elements would have different RGB values.

In digital imaging applications, these pixel matrices are usually manipulated using software libraries that can handle large amounts of data efficiently. The particular representation of an image in a computer also depends on the file format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.). Each format has its own way of encoding pixel color data to compress the file size without sacrificing too much image quality. 

In summary, while representation of images as pixel matrices is quite simple for small, stylized examples like numbers or simple shapes, when it comes to complex real-world images, the matrices would be very large and contain a wide range of RGB values.
