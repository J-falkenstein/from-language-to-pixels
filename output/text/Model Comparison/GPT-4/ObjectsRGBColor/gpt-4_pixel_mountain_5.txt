The following representation is an oversimplified example and it does not accommodate the complexity of an actual mountain image. In reality, images of nature or any real-life object are highly complex and contain millions of pixels, each with subtle variations in RGB values. Furthermore, 8x8 pixel images are too small to capture detailed representations.

This represents a very simple and abstract image of a mountain. The (255, 255, 255) values represent white (or the sky), the various shades of green and gray values may represent the mountain, and the higher intensity values in the middle could represent the peak of the mountain.
