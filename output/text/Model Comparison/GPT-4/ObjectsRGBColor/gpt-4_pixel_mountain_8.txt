Representing a complex image like a mountain with a pixel matrix in text format would be incredibly extensive and beyond the scope of this platform. This is due to the fact that every single pixel in the image would have a unique RGB value to create the natural color variations and details found in a mountain landscape.

For the sake of simplicity, let's consider a simplified two-color (black and white) 8x8 pixel representation of a mountain. In this case, we'll use '1' to indicate black (the mountain) and '0' to indicate white (the sky), just for better readability. 

[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

This is a very abstract representation. In a real image, you would likely have thousands or even millions of pixels in both the height and width, and each pixel would be represented as an RGB value instead of a single digit.
