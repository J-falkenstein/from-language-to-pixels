I'm sorry, I cannot provide a visual representation of a pixel grid for an image of a padlock as this is a text-based interface and doesn't support such illustrations. But I can describe it verbally:

The image could be represented by a pixel matrix where some pixels have certain RGB values to represent a padlock shape while others represent the background. The padlock shape would have pixels with an RGB value different from the background to represent the different parts of the padlock: the body, the shackle, and the keyhole. Depending on the color of the padlock and the background, different RGB values would be used. 

For example, if the padlock is black on a white background, the pixels representing the padlock might have an RGB value of (0, 0, 0) while the background pixels have an RGB value of (255, 255, 255). 

Similarly, if the padlock was red on a blue background, the padlock pixels might have an RGB value of (255, 0, 0) while the background pixels have an RGB value of (0, 0, 255). In either case, the specific arrangement and pattern of these pixels would form an image of a padlock when viewed as a whole.
