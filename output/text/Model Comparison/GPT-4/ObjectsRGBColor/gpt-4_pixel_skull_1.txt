As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create a visual representation of a pixel matrix for a skull image.

However, I can explain how it would be organized conceptually. You would have a 2D array (matrix) representing the width and height of the image in pixels. Each pixel would be represented by three color intensities (red, green, and blue) ranging between 0 and 255. 

For instance, a monochrome (black and white) skull image would mostly contain pixels of (255, 255, 255) for the white background, and (0, 0, 0) for the black portions forming the shape and features of the skull. The arrangement and distribution of these black pixels in the matrix would create the appearance of a skull when viewed as an image.
