As an AI language model, currently, I'm unable to generate a visual example of a grid of pixels that forms an image of a skull. However, I can provide an abstract textual explanation for it.

For example, we might have a 10x10 pixel matrix, where each pixel is either black (represented as (0,0,0)) or white (represented as (255, 255, 255)). Then, the grid of pixels would look generally like this:

```
[ (255, 255, 255) ... (255, 255, 255) ]  x 10 times for the top and bottom rows
[ (255, 255, 255) (0, 0, 0) ... (0, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ] for rows two and nine
[ (255, 255, 255) (0, 0, 0) ... (0, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ] for rows three and eight
[ (255, 255, 255) (0, 0, 0) ... (0, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ] for rows four and seven
[ (255, 255, 255) (0, 0, 0) ... (0, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ] for row five
[ (255, 255, 255) (0, 0, 0) ... (0, 0, 0) (255, 255, 255) ] for row six
```

In this scenario, the (0, 0, 0) pixels would represent the design of the skull on the square grid. You would need a larger grid and suitable pixel placements to display detailed images.
