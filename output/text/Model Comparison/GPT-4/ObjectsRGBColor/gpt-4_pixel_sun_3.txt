(Note: The following representation is primarily for illustrative purposes. It's challenging to represent an image of the sun accurately using ASCII text.)

Considering a simple 8x8 pixel representation of a 'sun-like' image in a sky. The sun will be represented by yellow (255, 255, 0) and the sky will be represented by light blue (135, 206, 235):
