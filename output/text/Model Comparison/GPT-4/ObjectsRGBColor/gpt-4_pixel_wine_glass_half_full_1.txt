Unfortunately, I am a text-based AI and cannot produce visual image representations. I can only provide a conceptual explanation. 

For a hypothetical example, let's consider a very simplified 8x8 pixel matrix for a black wine glass image on a white background. 

1. The top rows might be all white, representing the empty part of the glass and the air above it.
2. Then, a couple of rows might have a few black pixels in the middle, representing the rim of the glass.
3. The next few rows might have black pixels forming a 'U' shape, representing the upper portion of the glass, with white pixels filling the 'U', representing the wine.
4. The lower rows would have more black pixels, representing the stem and the base of the glass.

Remember, each pixel would actually be a set of RGB values (0,0,0 for black and 255,255,255 for white in this case). An actual digital image would have many more pixels, allowing for much more detail and color variation.
