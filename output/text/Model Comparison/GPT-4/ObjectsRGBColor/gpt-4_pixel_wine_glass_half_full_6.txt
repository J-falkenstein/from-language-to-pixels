Given the complexity of defining a specific image through a written description, it is challenging to express an image of a wine glass half full in terms of a grid of pixels without visual representation. However, below is a simplified and abstract interpretation of an 8x8 pixel grid representing a wine glass half full. Note that white represents the background, black represents the wine glass, and red represents the wine.

It's important to mention that given the limited resolution of an 8x8 grid, exact representation of complex elements or images like a wine glass might not be possible. Using larger grids or matrices could allow for more detailed representation.
