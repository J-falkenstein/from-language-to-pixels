Representing complex images like a wine glass half full in a text format would be quite challenging, especially with only an 8x8 grid. Lower-resolution grids are more suitable for representing simple shapes and letters. For more detailed and realistic images, a higher resolution matrix is needed, often with thousands or millions of pixels. 

However, you might create an abstract, simplified representation of a wine glass half full as follows:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 100)(0, 0, 100)(0, 0, 100)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

In this example, we use black (0, 0, 0) to outline the wine glass, white (255, 255, 255) for the empty part, and dark blue (0, 0, 100) for the wine. Notice this represents the broad strokes of the idea rather than creating a realistic image. In a higher resolution matrix, we could represent more detail and have a gradient for the wine and glass.
