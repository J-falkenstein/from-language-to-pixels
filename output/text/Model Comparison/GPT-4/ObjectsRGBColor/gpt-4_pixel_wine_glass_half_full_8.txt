Since it is difficult to provide pixel representation for complex objects like a wine glass, the given example can't be displayed in text form. The concept of representing an image in pixel form would be the same â€” each pixel would contain a RGB value representing a specific color and their combination would form the image. 

In an actual scenario, we would require more than just an 8x8 pixel matrix to create a more detailed and recognizable image of a wine glass. However, we can attempt to represent a very simplified and abstract version of a wine glass with an 8x8 matrix:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

Please note that this is a very abstract representation and might not look like a wine glass without using your imagination. In real-world applications, images are often represented by high resolution pixel matrices, like 800x800 or 1920x1080, instead of small 8x8 matrices.
