Sorry, there seems to be a misunderstanding. A single 8 by 8 pixel matrix can only represent a single digit or character at a time. The number 10 would require two separate grid matrices as it is a two-digit number. Here are the grid matrices for 1 and 0 separately.

Number 1:
00000000
00011000
00111000
00011000
00011000
00011000
00111110
00000000
