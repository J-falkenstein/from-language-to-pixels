As the images are represented as an 8 by 8 pixel grid, the number 10 would be represented as two different images, one for the number 1 and one for the number 0. Here, we illustrate this as two consecutive grids.

The number 1:
00000000
00011000
00111000
00011000
00011000
00011000
01111110
00000000
