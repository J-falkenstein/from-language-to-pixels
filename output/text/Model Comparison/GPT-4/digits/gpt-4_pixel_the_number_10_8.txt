Since a 8x8 pixel matrix can only represent a single digit or character, representing the number 10 would require two separate 8x8 matrices. One for the digit '1' and another for the digit '0'. 

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of the number one:
00000000
00011000
00111000
00011000
00011000
00011000
00111110
00000000
