There seems to be a misunderstanding. Given the specified constraints of an 8x8 pixel grid, it is not possible to accurately represent two-digit numbers like 32. The limitation of the grid size makes it impossible to depict two distinct numbers without them blending into each other. Each number would require a minimum of 3x5 pixels for a very basic and crude representation. Using those dimensions, there wouldn't be enough space for both numbers in an 8x8 grid. Even if the numbers were created without any spacing between them, they would still exceed the grid size.
