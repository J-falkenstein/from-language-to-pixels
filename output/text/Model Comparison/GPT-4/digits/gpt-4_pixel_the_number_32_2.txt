This would be a bit tricky, since the numbers would need to be quite small to fit within the 8x8 pixel limits. You might have to show them separately as two different images.

Here is an example of a grid of pixels forming the image of the number three:

00000000
00111100
00000110
00111100
00000110
00111100
00000000
00000000
