Sorry, but it's impossible to represent the number 32 in an 8 by 8 pixel grid as they are two-digit numbers. We can only display each number in a single grid because there are not enough pixels to represent both the numbers "3" and "2" simultaneously in one 8x8 grid. You would need a larger grid to represent the more complex shape of a two-digit number or additional grids to represent each digit separately.
