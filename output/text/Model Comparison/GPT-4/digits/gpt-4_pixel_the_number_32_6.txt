The concept of a 8 by 8 pixel matrix wouldn't be able to accurately represent multi-digit numbers like "32". Each number would need its own 8 by 8 matrix for better clarity and understanding. However, a simplified representation might look like this:

For Number 3:
00000000
00111100
00000110
00111100
00000110
00111100
00000000
00000000

For Number 2:
00000000
00111100
01100110
00000110
00011000
00101000
01111110
00000000
