In this example, black represents the letter 'I' while white represents the background. The grid is organized into horizontal rows and vertical columns, with each entry in the grid corresponding to a pixel. Each pixel has an RGB value that represents its color. The 'I' is represented by pixels with a value of (0,0,0) which represents black, while the background is represented by pixels with a value of (255,255,255) which represents white.
