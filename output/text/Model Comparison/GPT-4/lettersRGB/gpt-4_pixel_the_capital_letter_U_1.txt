This is a simplified representation and would appear as a 'U' shape with a black color against a white background when visualized. Each '0, 0, 0' represents a black pixel and each '255, 255, 255' represents a white pixel. Keep in mind that in a real-world scenario, an image would contain many more pixels and color variations.
