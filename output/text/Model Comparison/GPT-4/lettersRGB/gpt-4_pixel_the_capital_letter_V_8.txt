Given the limitations of text formatting, it's challenging to represent a capital letter V using pixels in the format mentioned in the text. However, imagine a matrix where each element is either (255, 255, 255) representing the color white for the background, or (0, 0, 0) representing the color black for the letter V. The scaling is also quite hard to get accurately in text, but the pixel arrangement might look something like this:

[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)]
[(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)]

Remember, the actual image representation would require far more pixels (a larger matrix) to accurately depict the letter V, but this should give you a rough idea.
