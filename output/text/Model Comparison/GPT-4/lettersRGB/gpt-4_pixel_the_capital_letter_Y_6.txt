Due to the nature of this platform, it is not possible to accurately visualize a pixel matrix of the capital letter 'Y'. However, I can describe a simplified example. This would be a grid where the RGB values for the pixels forming the 'Y' are black (0, 0, 0) and the rest of the pixels (background) are white (255, 255, 255). 

Remember that in a real world scenario, the matrix would be much bigger and the color representation would be far more complex to allow for varying shades and gradients. A simple 8 by 8 matrix won't truly depict the complexity and details of a 'Y' letter image. It's only for illustrative purposes. 

Here's a simplified and unrealistic 8 by 8 pixel matrix representation of the letter 'Y':
