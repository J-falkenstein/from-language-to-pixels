As a text-based AI, I'm afraid I can't visually represent an image such as a letter "Ö". However, if a pixel matrix was used to create the letter "Ö", it would involve using a grid of pixels where certain pixels would denote the specific shapes that form the letter. The color of the "Ö" and its background would be presented using specific RGB color values. 

For instance, if we wanted to create a black "Ö" on a white background, the pixel values for "Ö" would be (0,0,0) while the background pixels would be (255,255,255). The exact placement of these pixels would depend on the size and resolution of the image. The higher the resolution, the more pixels would be used, making the letter appear more precise and smooth.

Due to the highly detailed nature of an "Ö", it's also likely that anti-aliasing would be used. This is a technique that smooths out the image by adding semi-transparent pixels along the edges of the letter. This creates a smoother transition between the letter and the background, preventing the image from appearing pixelated. 

Keep in mind, while it would be possible to create even a large image using this method, it would involve manually specifying the RGB values for thousands or even millions of pixels, which would not be possible to represent in a text-based format here. In real-world applications, images are usually created and edited using graphic software, and the pixel matrix is stored in the image file.
