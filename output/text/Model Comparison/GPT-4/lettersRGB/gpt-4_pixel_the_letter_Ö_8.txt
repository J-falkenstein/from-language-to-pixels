The representation of images, including special characters such as 'Ö', as pixel matrices is largely abstract and may not display correctly in all formats. However, one could potentially create a simple 8x8 grid to represent an extremely simplified, pixelated version of 'Ö'. Keep in mind that this portrayal would not be refined because of the limitations of the 8x8 matrix. 

Also, it's crucial to understand that this is a general conceptual representation and may not look exactly like the letter 'Ö'. An actual image would require a higher resolution and grayscale or color variations for the necessary curves and edges.

Here is an example of a simple black and white representation of 'Ö' where (0,0,0) represents black and (255,255,255) represents white:

``` 
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(0,0,0)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]
[ (255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255)(255,255,255) ]

Remember this is a simplified representation and does not accurately depict how 'Ö' would look in a real image.
