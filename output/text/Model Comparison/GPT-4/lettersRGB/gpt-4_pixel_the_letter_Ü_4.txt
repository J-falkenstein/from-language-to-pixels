This specific example would depend on the color scheme and size chosen for the image. But considering a black (0, 0, 0) character on a white (255, 255, 255) background, in an 8x8 pixel matrix, a simple representation of the letter "Ü" cannot be accomplished due to the limitation of the dimensions, as the umlaut requires additional pixels.

However, assuming that a larger pixel matrix is used, a depiction of the letter "Ü" would involve black pixels (indicating the letter itself) surrounded by a large number of white pixels (indicating the background). If color is included, the RGB values for each pixel would change to correspond to the desired color for the letter and the background.

Note: The real-world application would involve a much larger matrix for a single letter, providing a higher level of detail. Also, it's important to note that many languages and text formats use more complex characters that can't be properly represented in a small pixel matrix. The examples in the previous answer were highly simplified and may not accurately represent how these characters would appear in an actual image or text display.
