Given that it's quite impossible to create an understandable image of the letter Ü in just an 8 by 8 pixel matrix, I'll use a 16 by 16 pixel matrix instead. White pixels will represent the letter Ü and black pixels will be the background. Here is an example:

[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0) ]
And so on, repeat this process for each row until you get a 16x16 letter Ü. 

Please note that creating a clear and understandable 'Ü' at such a small size is quite challenging. Also, this is a very simplified representation and an actual pixelated image would involve more complex rendering to handle anti-aliasing and other visual properties.
