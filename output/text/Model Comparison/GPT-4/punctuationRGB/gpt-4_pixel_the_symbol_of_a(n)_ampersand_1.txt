Creating a pixel matrix for a complex shape like an ampersand is challenging with limited resolution. It would require a more advanced image processing technique. However, a simplistic, low-resolution example might look something like this:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

In this representation, the zeroes (which in the RGB model represent black) form an oversimplified version of an ampersand symbol. A more accurate representation would require a larger matrix and a more diverse range of color values.
