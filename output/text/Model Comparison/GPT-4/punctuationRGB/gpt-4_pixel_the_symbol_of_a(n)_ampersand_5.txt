Working with non-iconic symbols such as an ampersand can be challenging considering its complex shape and curvature. We will still assume that we are working with an 8x8 grid, although this grid might be too small to accurately represent an ampersand, it can be used to give a rough representation. Here is a rough, simple example:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

Note: The resultant image will depend on the styling of the ampersand and the complexity of the font used. This is a very rudimentary example based on a basic block-style font. To get a more representational pixel matrix, a larger grid or a specific font design would be required.
