Given this is a text-based format, it's challenging to depict a complex symbol like a percentage sign using an 8x8 pixel matrix. However, assuming we use (0, 0, 0) for our symbol color (black) and (255, 255, 255) for the background color (white), a simplified representation might look something like this:

[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(0, 0, 0)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]
[ (255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255)(255, 255, 255) ]

Please note that this is a highly simplified representation and would probably not be recognizable as a percentage sign in a real image. A larger grid size would allow for a more accurate representation.
