Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of a house:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this image, the 0s represent black pixels and the 1s represent white pixels. The arrangement of the pixels forms the shape of a house.
