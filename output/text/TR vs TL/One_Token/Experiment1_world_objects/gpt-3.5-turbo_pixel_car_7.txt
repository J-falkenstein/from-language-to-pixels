Unfortunately, I cannot generate images in this text-based format. However, you can create your own pixel matrix representation of a car by using 0s and 1s. Each 0 or 1 represents a black or white pixel, respectively. Here is a simple example to get you started:

```
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
```

Feel free to modify and expand on this template to create your own representation of a car.
