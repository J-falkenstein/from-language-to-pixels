Unfortunately, I cannot generate images here as I am a text-based AI. However, you can create an image of a cat by representing it using a pixel matrix of size 8 by 8. Each entry in the matrix would represent a pixel, either black (0) or white (1). You can create the matrix by drawing the cat's shape using a combination of 0s and 1s. Here's a simple example of what the pixel matrix for a cat could look like:

1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

This is just a simple representation, and you can modify and refine it to create a more detailed and accurate image of a cat.
