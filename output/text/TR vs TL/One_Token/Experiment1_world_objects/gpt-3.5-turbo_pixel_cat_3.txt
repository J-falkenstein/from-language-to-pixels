Apologies, as an AI text-based model, I am unable to generate or display images. However, I can describe how a pixel matrix representing an image of a cat could look like. Here is a possible representation:

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0

Please note that this is just one possible representation, and there can be many variations of a cat image depending on the style and details desired.
