Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I cannot provide visual images directly. However, I can help you describe how to create a pixel matrix for an image of a cat.

To create an image of a cat using a pixel matrix, you would need to determine the pattern of black and white pixels that represents the cat's shape. Each entry in the matrix would represent a pixel, where 0 represents a black pixel and 1 represents a white pixel.

Here is a possible description for an image of a cat:

 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

Please note that this is just one example, and there can be many different ways to represent a cat using a pixel matrix.
