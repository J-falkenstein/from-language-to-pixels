Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to generate visual images. However, I can provide you with a description of what the pixel grid for an image of a cat might look like:

A 8 by 8 pixel matrix representing an image of a cat could be:

0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
