Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to generate or display images. However, I can describe to you what the pixel matrix for an image of a chair could look like:

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of a chair:
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

Each "1" represents a black pixel, while each "0" represents a white pixel. The arrangement of the pixels creates the shape of a chair.
