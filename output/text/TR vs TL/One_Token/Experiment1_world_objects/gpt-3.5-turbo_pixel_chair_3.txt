Apologies, but as an AI language model, I cannot directly display images. However, I can help you create a textual representation of an image of a chair using a pixel matrix. Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of a chair:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this representation, 0s represent black pixels, while 1s represent white pixels. Adjust this matrix as per your preference and resolution.
