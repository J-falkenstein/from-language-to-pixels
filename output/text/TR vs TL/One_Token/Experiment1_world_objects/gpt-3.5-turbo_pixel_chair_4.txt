Apologies, but as a text-based AI, I am unable to generate or display images. However, I can guide you on how to create a pixel matrix to represent an image of a chair. A chair can be represented as a combination of black and white pixels. You can create an 8 by 8 pixel matrix where each entry represents a pixel. Use 0 to represent a black pixel and 1 to represent a white pixel. Be creative and arrange the pixels to form the shape of a chair.
