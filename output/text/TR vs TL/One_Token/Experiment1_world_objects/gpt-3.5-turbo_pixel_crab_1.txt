I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to generate or display images. However, I can help you understand how to create a pixel matrix representation of a crab. A crab typically has a round body with pincers and legs.

To create a pixel matrix representation, you can start by sketching or imagining the crab's shape. Then, assign 0s and 1s to each pixel based on whether it should be black or white. Keep in mind that the matrix size should be 8x8.

Here is a sample representation of a crab:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Please note that this is a simple and rough representation. You can adjust and modify the matrix to make the crab look more detailed or realistic.
