Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I cannot generate or display images directly. However, I can help describe the image of a crown using a pixel matrix.

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that could represent an image of a crown:

1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

In this matrix, a '1' represents a black pixel, while a '0' represents a white pixel. The matrix shows a simplified representation of a crown shape, with a pattern of alternating black and white pixels. Please note that the actual appearance of a crown can vary depending on its design and level of detail.
