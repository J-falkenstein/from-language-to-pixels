Unfortunately, I am unable to provide an image here as I am a text-based AI model. However, I can help you create a pixel matrix representation of a fly. Here is an example:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this representation, the fly is depicted using 0s and 1s, where 0 represents a black pixel and 1 represents a white pixel. The matrix is 8 by 8, just like the examples given earlier.
