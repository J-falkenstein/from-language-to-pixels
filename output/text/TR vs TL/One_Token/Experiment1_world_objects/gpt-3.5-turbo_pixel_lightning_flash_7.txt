Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of a lightning flash:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This pixel matrix represents a lightning flash with a black background (0s) and a white lightning bolt (1s).
