Unfortunately, I am an AI text-based model and cannot create or display images. However, I can describe what a pixel matrix representing an image of a mountain might look like:

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this pixel matrix, the black pixels represent the outline and shape of the mountain, while the white pixels represent the background.
