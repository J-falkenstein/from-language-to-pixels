Sorry, I am an AI language model and cannot generate or display images. However, I can describe how an image of a mountain could be represented in a pixel matrix.

A mountain image could be represented using a pixel matrix where each entry represents a black or white pixel. The matrix would be of size 8 by 8, with 1s representing black pixels and 0s representing white pixels. The specific pattern of black and white pixels would form the shape of the mountain.

Here is an example of a pixel matrix that could represent an image of a mountain:
1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

Please note that this is just one example, and the specific arrangement of pixels can vary to create different representations of a mountain image.
