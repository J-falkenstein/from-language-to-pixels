Apologies, but as an AI text-based model, I am unable to generate pixel-based images. However, I can help you describe what a mountain image might look like using words. A mountain image typically consists of triangular peaks, varying terrain, and often includes elements like trees, snow, and clouds. The colors used can range from earthy tones for the mountains, greens for the trees, white for snow, and various shades of blue for the sky and clouds. The image may also include other details such as a sun or moon, depending on the desired scene.
