Unfortunately, I am an AI text-based model and cannot generate or display images directly. However, I can provide you with a pixel matrix representation of a mountain image:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

This is a simplified representation, and you can imagine it as a mountain shape formed by the black and white pixels.
