Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to directly generate images. However, I can describe to you how a grid of pixels might form an image of a mountain. 

An image of a mountain could consist of various shades of gray or colors to represent different areas of the mountain, such as the peaks, slopes, and valleys. The grid would be a matrix of 8 by 8, where each entry represents a pixel of a certain color. The colors could be represented by numbers or symbols, such as 0 for black, 1 for white, or different numbers for various shades of gray or RGB values for colors.

For example, a simplified representation could be:
 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This representation is just an example, and the specific pattern and arrangement of pixels would vary depending on the artistic style and level of detail desired for the image of the mountain.
