Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to provide a visual image. However, I can help you create a pixel matrix of a skull image. 

To represent the skull image, you can use a combination of 0s and 1s in an 8 by 8 pixel matrix. The 0s will represent the black pixels, while the 1s will represent the white pixels. You can arrange the pixels in a way that forms the shape of a skull.

Here is an example of a pixel matrix that can represent a skull image:

0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

In this matrix, the 1s form the outline and features of the skull image, while the 0s create the background.

I hope this helps!
