Unfortunately, I cannot generate an image here as I am a text-based AI. However, you can create your own grid of pixels to represent an image of a skull. Use a 8x8 matrix where each entry represents a black or white pixel. You can arrange the pixels in a way that resembles a skull shape. Remember, the image will be simplified due to the limited number of pixels.
