Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to provide visual representations of images. However, you can create your own 8 by 8 pixel matrix to depict a skull by using 0s and 1s. For example:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this representation, the 1s depict black pixels and the 0s depict white pixels. Adjust the arrangement and pattern of 1s and 0s to create your own unique skull image.
