Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of a stick figure:

0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

Each 0 or 1 represents a black or white pixel, respectively, forming the image of a stick figure.
