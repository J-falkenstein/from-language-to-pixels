Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I am unable to generate or display visual images. However, I can guide you on how to create a pixel matrix representation of a stick figure.

To create a pixel matrix representation of a stick figure, you can use the following 8 by 8 pixel matrix:

0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this representation, 1s represent black pixels, while 0s represent white pixels. You can adjust and modify this pixel matrix as per your desired stick figure design.
