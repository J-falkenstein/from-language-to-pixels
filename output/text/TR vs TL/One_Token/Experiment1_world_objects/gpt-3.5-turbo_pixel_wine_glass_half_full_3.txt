Apologies, as a text-based AI, I am unable to directly generate images. However, I can describe how a wine glass half full might be represented in a pixel matrix. 

Assuming a black and white representation, the following example might depict a wine glass half full:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

In this representation, "0" represents a white pixel (empty space), and "1" represents a black pixel (filled space).
