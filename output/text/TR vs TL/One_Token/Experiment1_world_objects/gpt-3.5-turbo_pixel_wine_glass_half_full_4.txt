Unfortunately, I am an AI language model and cannot directly generate images. However, I can provide you with a textual representation of a wine glass half full using the pixel matrix format:

0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this representation, 1s represent black pixels (filled) and 0s represent white pixels (empty). Please note that this representation may not accurately depict a wine glass half full in terms of its shape and details, as it is a simplified representation using a limited number of pixels.
