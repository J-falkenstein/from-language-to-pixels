Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I cannot provide you with a visual image. However, I can describe how a pixel matrix representation of a wine glass half full might look like:

Assuming each entry in the matrix represents a pixel, a wine glass half full image could be represented by a 8 by 8 matrix. Since the glass is half full, the upper half of the matrix would contain white pixels (1s) and the lower half would contain black pixels (0s).

Here is an example of how the matrix might look like:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This representation would depict a wine glass image with the upper half filled with white pixels, representing the glass being half full, while the lower half is empty, represented by black pixels.
