A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 1 can consist of a vertical line placed in the center of the canvas. The line should span the full height of the canvas, reaching from the top to the bottom. The width of the line should be one pixel. This representation captures the essential shape and distinctive trait of the number 1, which is its vertical alignment. The proportions of the line should be such that it occupies approximately one-eighth of the width of the canvas.
