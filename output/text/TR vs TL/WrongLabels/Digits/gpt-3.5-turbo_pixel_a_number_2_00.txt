A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 2 can be described as follows:

The fundamental shape of the number 2 consists of a vertical line on the left side, reaching from the top to the bottom of the frame. This line should ideally extend two-thirds of the total height, ending slightly above the bottom edge.

At the top right corner of the vertical line, a curved diagonal line starts, bending to the right and sloping downwards. This diagonal curve should form a soft angle, roughly at a 45-degree angle, and extend to the right side of the frame at a position slightly below the mid-height point.

To complete the number 2, a small horizontal line is added, connecting the bottom of the diagonal curve with the vertical line, forming a gentle curve that mirrors the shape of the diagonal curve. This horizontal line should be shorter in length, reaching about one-third across the width of the frame from the right side.

The proportions and alignment play a crucial role in achieving a recognizable number 2. The vertical line should occupy about two-thirds of the height, the diagonal curve should bend at a 45-degree angle, and the horizontal line should mirror the curve and be shorter in length.

In summary, a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 2 consists of a vertical line taking up two-thirds of the height on the left side, a curved diagonal line starting from the top right corner, and a shorter horizontal line connecting the bottom of the diagonal curve to the vertical line.
