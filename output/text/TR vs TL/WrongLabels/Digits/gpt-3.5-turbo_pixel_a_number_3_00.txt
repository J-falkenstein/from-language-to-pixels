A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 3 could have the following features:

1. Shape: The number 3 can be represented by a curved shape resembling a backward "C" with a diagonal line through its center.
2. Distinctive traits: The diagonal line cuts across the curved part of the "C," suggesting the connection between the upper and lower portions of the number. The top portion of the "C" is relatively larger than the lower section.
3. Proportions: The top part of the "C" takes about two-thirds of the total height, while the lower part occupies one-third.
4. Alignments: The number 3 can be placed either in the center of the 8x8 pixel grid or slightly shifted to the left to accommodate more spacing on the right side.
5. Spatial relationships: The diagonal line starts near the top-right corner of the 8x8 grid and ends near the bottom-left corner, intersecting the curved part of the "C" in the middle.

By keeping these essential aspects in mind, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a number 3 can be created, allowing for recognition within the limited space provided.
