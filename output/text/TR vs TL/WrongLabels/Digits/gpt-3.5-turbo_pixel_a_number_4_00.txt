A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 4 would consist of a vertical line on the left side of the grid, starting from the top and extending down to the fifth row of pixels. This vertical line would be followed by a horizontal line on the bottom, spanning from the first pixel of the fifth row to the last pixel on the eighth row. This horizontal line would be positioned towards the right side of the grid. 

The vertical line represents the longer stroke of the number 4, while the horizontal line represents the shorter stroke at the bottom. The proportion between the vertical and horizontal lines should be approximately 2:1 to maintain recognition. 

In terms of alignment, the vertical line should be centered in the leftmost column of the grid, while the horizontal line should be close to the bottom and slightly aligned towards the right side. 

By utilizing these essential features, a simplified representation of a number 4 can be created within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel grid.
