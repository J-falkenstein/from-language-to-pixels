In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of number 5, the essential features for recognition would be as follows:

1. Shape: The number 5 would be represented by a vertical line on the left side, extending from the top to the bottom of the image, with a slight curve at the bottom.

2. Distinctive traits: The top part of the number 5 would feature a small horizontal line, connecting to the vertical line slightly above its midpoint. The bottom curve would be slightly larger than the top curve.

3. Proportions: The vertical line would take up approximately 3-4 pixels in width, while the top and bottom curves would be around 2-3 pixels in length.

4. Alignment: The vertical line should be positioned towards the left side of the 8x8 pixel grid, leaving space on the right for the curve.

5. Spatial relationships: The top curve should be positioned slightly above the middle of the vertical line, while the bottom curve should start a few pixels below the vertical line and curve outward slightly.

By focusing on these essential elements, this simplified representation of the number 5 can be recognized within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
