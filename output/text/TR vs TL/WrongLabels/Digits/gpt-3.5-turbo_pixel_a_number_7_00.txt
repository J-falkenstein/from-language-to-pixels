In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a number 7, the fundamental shape can be achieved by utilizing a vertical line occupying the second column from the left, starting from the top and running to the bottom. This line should span five pixels in length. 

To accentuate the number 7's distinctive traits, a shorter diagonal line can be added diagonally downwards from the top left corner pixel to the center pixel of the third row, aligning it with the top end of the vertical line. This diagonal line should consist of three pixels, forming a slanted angle. 

Additionally, a longer diagonal line can be incorporated in the opposite direction, from the top right corner pixel to the bottom left corner pixel. This line should start from the top right corner pixel and descend diagonally towards the bottom left corner pixel, spanning the entire width of the bottom row. 

Lastly, to preserve proportions and spatial relationships in this simplified rendition, it is important to ensure that the vertical line is centered within the second column, and the shorter diagonal line aligns with its top end. The longer diagonal line should align with the top right corner and extend to the bottom left corner, maintaining a consistent angle throughout.
