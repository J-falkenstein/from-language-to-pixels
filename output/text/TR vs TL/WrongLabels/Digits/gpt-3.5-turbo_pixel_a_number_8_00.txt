A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the number 8 would consist of a central, horizontally elongated oval shape that forms the main body of the number. The horizontal width of the oval occupies approximately 5 out of the 8 pixels. The oval is slightly taller than it is wide, taking up around 6 pixels vertically. 

To accentuate the upper and lower loops of the number 8, two smaller semi-circular shapes are added, aligned with the top and bottom of the central oval. These semi-circular shapes are about 2 pixels wide and 1 pixel tall. The upper loop is positioned just above the center of the oval, while the lower loop is placed just below the center of the oval. 

The central oval and the loops are connected by two diagonal lines that help to complete the number 8's shape. The diagonal lines extend from the outer edge of the central oval and intersect with the inner edges of the upper and lower loops. These diagonal lines should have a slight angle, forming around 45 degrees with the horizontal axis. 

Overall, the simplified 8x8 pixel representation emphasizes the essential features of the number 8, including the elongated oval body, the upper and lower loops, and the diagonal lines that connect them.
