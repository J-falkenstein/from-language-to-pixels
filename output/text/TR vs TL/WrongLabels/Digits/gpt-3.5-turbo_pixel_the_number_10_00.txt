A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the number 10 would consist of two vertical lines. The left line should start from the top-left corner and extend downward for 6 pixels. The right line should start from the top-right corner and also extend downward for 6 pixels. The gap between these two lines should be approximately one pixel wide. This representation emphasizes the essential features of the number 10, namely the two vertical strokes that form the digits. The overall proportion should maintain the vertical lines at a height of 6 pixels with a one-pixel gap between them.
