A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the number 32 may consist of a rectangular shape with slightly rounded corners. The rectangular shape should fill the central area of the 8x8 grid, occupying approximately 6 pixels in width and 4 pixels in height. The top left corner of the rectangle should be aligned with the top left corner of the grid. The sides of the rectangle should have a slightly convex curvature towards the center. The bottom right corner of the rectangle should be slightly more rounded than the other corners, resembling a quarter-circle. The horizontal line separating the upper and lower parts of the number 32 should be located slightly above the center of the rectangle, taking up approximately 2 pixels in height. The overall shape should be compact and clearly distinguishable within the limited space provided by the 8x8 pixel grid.
