A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the number 9 would be a vertical line starting from the top left corner and extending down to the bottom left corner, occupying the leftmost column of pixels. At the top right corner of this line, there would be a small horizontal line extending towards the rightmost column of pixels, around two-thirds of the way down the vertical line. This horizontal line would be slightly shorter than the vertical line to signify the curve of the number 9. The space between the horizontal and vertical lines would be left empty to create a distinct separation between the two. The proportions should be such that the vertical line occupies around two-thirds of the height of the canvas, and the horizontal line occupies about one-third of the width. By adhering to these simplified shapes and proportions, the essential features of the number 9 can be conveyed, enabling its recognition within the limited space provided.
