A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter A would consist of the following:

- Starting from the top left corner, the first row would contain 3 pixels, forming a horizontal line.
- The second row would have 2 pixels, forming a diagonal line connecting the top left and top right corners.
- The third row would again contain 3 pixels, forming a horizontal line.
- The fourth row would consist of just 1 pixel, placed at the center.
- The fifth row would be empty.
- The sixth row would be identical to the fourth row, with 1 pixel at the center.
- The seventh row would again have 3 pixels, forming a horizontal line.
- The eighth row would contain 8 pixels, forming a horizontal line.

This simplified representation emphasizes the essential characteristics of an uppercase letter A, such as the diagonal slant and the horizontal crossbar. The proportions depend on the specific style being used, but generally the crossbar is positioned slightly above the middle of the letter.
