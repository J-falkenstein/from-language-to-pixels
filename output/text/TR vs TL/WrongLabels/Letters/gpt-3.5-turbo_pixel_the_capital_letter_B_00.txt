A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter B can be created by dividing the 8x8 grid into four columns and six rows. 

Starting from the top left corner, the first column comprises four filled pixels that form a vertical line. The second column consists of two filled pixels arranged diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, representing the slanted stroke of the letter B. 

Moving to the third column, the first pixel is filled to create the upper part of the rounded loop of the B, while the second, third, and fourth pixels remain empty to form the gap between the two parts of the letter. 

In the fourth column, the first pixel is filled to represent the lower part of the rounded loop, and the remaining three pixels are empty. 

The fifth, sixth, and seventh columns are completely empty. 

Finally, the eighth column consists of two filled pixels aligned diagonally from the top right to the bottom left, mirroring the slanted stroke on the left side of the letter B.

Overall, this simplified rendition of the capital letter B emphasizes the vertical line, slanted strokes, and rounded loop, while omitting intricate details such as curves and intersections found in a more elaborate representation.
