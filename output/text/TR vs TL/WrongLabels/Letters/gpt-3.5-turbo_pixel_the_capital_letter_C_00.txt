In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation, the capital letter C can be depicted as a circle with a gap on the right side. The circle should fill the majority of the 8x8 grid, spanning from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The top-left corner and the bottom-right corner should be rounded, while the right side should have a slight indentation, leaving a small gap before reaching the top and bottom edges. The top and bottom edges should be parallel and evenly spaced. The overall shape should be distinct and recognizable as the letter C, even with the omission of intricate details.
