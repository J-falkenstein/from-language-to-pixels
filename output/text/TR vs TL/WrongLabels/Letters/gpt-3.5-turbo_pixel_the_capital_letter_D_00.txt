A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter D can be created by representing the letter as a solid rectangular shape with a semicircle attached to the right side. 

Starting from the top-left corner, the first row consists of eight black pixels. The second row has the first and last pixels black, with the remaining six pixels left white. The third row is similar to the second row, but with an additional black pixel at the center. 

The fourth row has the first and last pixels black, with the remaining six pixels left white. In the fifth row, the first two and last two pixels are black, while the middle four pixels are white. 

The sixth row is similar to the fifth row, but with an additional black pixel at the center. The seventh row has the first and last pixels black, while the second and second-to-last pixels are also black. The remaining four pixels are white. 

The eighth and final row consists of eight black pixels. 

This simplified 8x8 pixel representation captures the essential features of the letter D, such as the rectangular body and the semicircular segment attached to the right side, allowing for recognition of the letter in a limited space.
