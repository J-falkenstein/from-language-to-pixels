A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter E would consist of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, extending from the top to the bottom. This line would be 2 pixels wide. At the top and bottom of the vertical line, there would be horizontal lines extending to the right, each 3 pixels long. These horizontal lines would be positioned at the top and bottom edges of the grid, with 1 pixel of space between the vertical line and the horizontal lines. This representation focuses on the essential features of an uppercase E by emphasizing the vertical and horizontal strokes, while omitting any intricate details.
