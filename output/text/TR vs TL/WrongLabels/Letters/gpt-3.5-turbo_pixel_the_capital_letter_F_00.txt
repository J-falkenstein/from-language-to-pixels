A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter F can be achieved as follows:

Start with a blank 8x8 grid. 

To create the letter F, place a vertical line that spans from the top to the bottom at the leftmost column of the grid, occupying the first and second rows. This line should be 2 pixels in width. 

Next, add a horizontal line that spans from the leftmost column to the fourth column, occupying the third row. This line should also be 2 pixels in width. 

Lastly, place a vertical line that spans from the fourth column to the sixth column, occupying the fourth and fifth rows. This line should be 2 pixels in width as well, and it should align with the bottom end of the previous horizontal line. 

By following these instructions, you will have created a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter F, focusing on its essential features and omitting intricate details.
