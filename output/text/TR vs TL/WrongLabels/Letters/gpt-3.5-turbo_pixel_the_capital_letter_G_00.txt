A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter G can be created by using a combination of straight lines and curves. The fundamental shape of the letter G consists of a vertical stem on the left side, which is slightly inclined towards the right at the top. The stem is connected to a curved line that starts from the top right corner and moves downwards, forming a semi-circular shape. 

To emphasize the essential features for recognition, the stem should cover the leftmost two pixels of the first three rows, while the remaining five pixels of these rows should be left empty. The stem should be aligned with the left edge, while the top of the stem should be located in the second row. 

The curved line should start at the top right corner of the canvas and move downwards, occupying the last two pixels of the first row and the first two pixels of the second row. The curve should be extended to the bottom right corner, forming a semi-circle. 

For clarity, the remaining pixels of the canvas should be left empty to avoid any unnecessary details. This simplified representation will allow viewers to recognize the capital letter G at a glance, despite the limited space and resolution.
