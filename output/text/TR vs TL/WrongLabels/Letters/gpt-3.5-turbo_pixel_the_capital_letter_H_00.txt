A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter H could be created by using a combination of vertical and horizontal lines. The letter H consists of two vertical lines that are parallel and of equal length, with a horizontal line intersecting them exactly in the middle. 

In the 8x8 pixel artwork, the two vertical lines can be represented by 8 pixels in height and 2 pixels in width, positioned side by side. The horizontal line can be represented by 6 pixels in width, positioned at the exact center of the artwork.

To emphasize the essential features, the remaining pixels in the 8x8 grid can be left blank or set to the background color to create a clear distinction between the letter H and its surroundings. The simple representation focuses on the proportional relationship between the vertical and horizontal lines, enabling easy recognition of the capital letter H within the limited pixel space.
