A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter I can be achieved by focusing on the essential features for recognition. The fundamental shape of the capital letter I is a vertical rectangle placed centrally within the 8x8 grid. The rectangle spans the entire height of the grid and occupies a 3x1 pixel area in the center, leaving the outer pixels blank.

To emphasize the distinctive traits and proportions of the letter, the thickness of the vertical lines can be increased to 2 pixels. The vertical lines should be aligned with the central columns of the grid, with a single pixel of space separating them from the outer edges of the grid.

In summary, the simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of the capital letter I consists of a vertical rectangle, 3 pixels wide and 8 pixels tall, placed centrally within the grid. The vertical lines have increased thickness, with a gap of one pixel separating them from the outer edges of the grid.
