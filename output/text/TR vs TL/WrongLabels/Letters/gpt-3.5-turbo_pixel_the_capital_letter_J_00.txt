A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter J would be a vertical line on the left side with a small horizontal line extending to the right at about two-thirds of the way up. The vertical line should take up approximately two-thirds of the height of the 8x8 canvas, starting from the top and aligned with the left edge. The horizontal line should be at the same height as the bottom of the vertical line and should extend to about two-thirds of the canvas width.
