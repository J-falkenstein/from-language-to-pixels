A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter L would consist of a vertical stem extending from the top to the bottom of the 8x8 grid, occupying the leftmost column. The stem would be 6 pixels in height, leaving the top two pixels of the grid empty. The width of the stem would be approximately 2 pixels, with the exact proportion dependent on the desired aesthetic. 

To enhance recognition, the bottom-left pixel of the stem should be filled to create a solid base. The remaining pixels of the grid can be left empty, serving as the background.

In summary, the simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter L would be a vertical stem on the leftmost column, 6 pixels in height and approximately 2 pixels in width, with a solid base in the bottom-left pixel.
