A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter M would consist of a vertical line in the center, spanning from the top to the bottom of the canvas (8 pixels in height). Above and slightly to the left of the centerline, there would be a diagonal line slanting towards the right, starting from the top left corner of the canvas and ending one pixel below the centerline. Similarly, above and slightly to the right of the centerline, there would be another diagonal line slanting towards the left, starting from the top right corner of the canvas and ending one pixel below the centerline. The two diagonal lines should intersect with the vertical centerline at one pixel below the center. The bottom half of the canvas would be filled with pixels, creating a solid rectangle shape.
