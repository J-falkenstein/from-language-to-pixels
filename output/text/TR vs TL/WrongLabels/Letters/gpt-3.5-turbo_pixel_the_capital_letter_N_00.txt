A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter N can be described as follows:

The capital letter N can be represented by an upright rectangular shape divided into two diagonally opposing triangles. The left triangle starts from the top-left corner and extends diagonally downwards towards the bottom-left corner, occupying three columns. The right triangle starts from the top-right corner, extending diagonally downwards towards the bottom-right corner, also occupying three columns. These two triangles are separated by a single vertical column located at the center of the shape. The top and bottom edges of the shape are straight and parallel to each other, with the triangles touching both edges. The triangles themselves have straight, diagonal edges. The ratio of the width of the triangles to the width of the center column is approximately 2:1. This simplified rendition of the capital letter N captures the essential features of the letter, allowing for easy recognition despite its minimal size.
