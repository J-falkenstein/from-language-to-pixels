A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter O would consist of a filled circular shape in the center of the pixel grid. The circle should take up most of the pixels, leaving a single-pixel width border around its edges. The outer circle's diameter should be six pixels, aligned in the center of the grid with equal distance to its edges. The central four pixels should be filled, representing the interior of the letter O. This simplified rendition focuses on the circular shape and does not include any additional details or embellishments.
