A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter Q would consist of a square shape tilted at a 45-degree angle. The square would have a diagonal line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, creating an "X" shape within the square. The top right and bottom left corners of the square would be filled, while the other two corners would be left empty. This empty space would form a small triangular shape at the top left and bottom right corners of the square. Finally, a small horizontal line would be added at the bottom center of the square, extending slightly outside the square's boundaries. This simplified rendition of the capital letter Q captures its recognizable features while taking into account space constraints.
