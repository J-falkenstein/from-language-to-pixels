A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter R can be achieved by focusing on its essential features while omitting intricate details. 

The letter R can be created by using a rectangular shape as the base, occupying the left side of the 8x8 pixel grid. The width of the rectangle should be approximately half the total grid width, covering pixels from columns 1 to 4.

To create the distinctive diagonal line, a V-shaped figure can be placed at the top right corner of the rectangular base, extending towards the bottom left corner. This V-shape should intersect the top and bottom edges of the rectangular base. It can be achieved by using pixels in rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, occupying columns 5 to 8.

The bottom right corner of the letter R can be rounded off by creating a small curved line using pixels in rows 4, 5, and 6, covering columns 7 and 8. This provides a visual separation from the base and adds to the recognition of the letter.

The remaining pixels in the grid should be left blank, as they are not essential for recognizing the letter R. 

Overall, this simplified representation of the capital letter R emphasizes the rectangular base, the diagonal line, and the rounded bottom right corner, allowing for its recognition within the 8x8 pixel artwork.
