A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter S can be created by using a combination of dark and light pixels. The essential features for recognition would be:

1. The letter S is composed of two curved lines that intersect.
2. The upper curve starts at the top left corner and slopes downwards towards the middle of the image.
3. The lower curve starts at the bottom left corner and slopes upwards towards the middle of the image.
4. The curves intersect in the middle of the image, forming a point of intersection.
5. The upper curve should occupy approximately the top two-thirds of the image, while the lower curve occupies the bottom third of the image.
6. The curves should maintain a consistent thickness throughout the image.
7. The image should be symmetrical horizontally, with the left side being a mirror image of the right side.

By following these simplified guidelines, a recognizable representation of the capital letter S can be achieved within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
