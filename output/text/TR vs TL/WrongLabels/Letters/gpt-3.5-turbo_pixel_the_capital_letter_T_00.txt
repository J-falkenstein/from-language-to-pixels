The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter T can be created by using the following description:

1. The letter T is composed of a vertical stroke placed centrally within the frame, spanning the entire height (8 pixels) of the 8x8 grid.
2. The width of the vertical stroke is 3 pixels, creating a thick line.
3. The topmost pixel of the vertical stroke is aligned with the top edge of the grid.
4. The bottommost pixel of the vertical stroke is aligned with the bottom edge of the grid.
5. The horizontal portion of the letter T is formed by a single pixel, aligned with the middle row (4th row) of the grid.
6. The horizontal pixel is positioned centrally within the frame, aligning with the leftmost and rightmost edges of the vertical stroke.

Using these instructions, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of the capital letter T can be created, emphasizing the essential features necessary for recognition while omitting intricate details.
