In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter U, the fundamental shape consists of a vertical line on the left side, followed by a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner. The diagonal line then curves smoothly towards the right, forming the bottom of the U shape, and ends with a vertical line on the right side. 

The vertical line on the left should take up the first column of pixels, while the diagonal line should start from the second column and go down towards the bottom-left corner, occupying the subsequent columns. The curve of the U should be expressed by a gradual shift in the diagonal line's direction, slightly curving towards the right.

To maintain proper proportions, the vertical lines should take up half of the height (4 pixels) while the diagonal line occupies the other half of the height. Align the diagonal line with the vertical line at the top-left corner and let it end at the bottom-right corner of the pixel grid to form a complete U shape.

By representing the essential features of a vertical line, a diagonal line, and a curved bottom, this simplified depiction of the capital letter U can be used as a basis for creating larger 8x8 pixel artwork while omitting intricate details due to the limited space available.
