A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter V would consist of an inverted "V" shape. The top left corner pixel and bottom right corner pixel would be colored to represent the outermost points of the inverted "V". The pixels between these two corners would be left empty or transparent, creating a clear space in the middle of the shape. The vertical sides of the "V" shape would slope inward and connect smoothly to the top and bottom corners. In this simplified representation, no extra pixels or details would be included, allowing for easy recognition of the capital letter V.
