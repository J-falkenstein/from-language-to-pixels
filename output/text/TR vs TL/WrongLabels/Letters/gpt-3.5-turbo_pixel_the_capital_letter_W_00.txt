A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter W can be described as follows:

The letter W is formed by three diagonal lines. Starting from the top left corner, the first diagonal line starts one pixel from the top and extends down and to the right, covering four pixels in total. The second diagonal line starts two pixels from the top and extends down and to the left, also covering four pixels. The third diagonal line starts one pixel from the bottom and extends up and to the right, covering three pixels. These lines intersect in the center to form the letter W.

To emphasize the recognition of the letter, the pixels along the edges of the lines should be turned on to indicate the outline, while the inner pixels should be left turned off. This will give a clear representation of the W shape within the 8x8 pixel grid.

It is important to maintain the proportions and alignment of the diagonal lines to ensure the legibility of the letter. The distance between the top and bottom line should be the same as the distance between the left and right lines to maintain symmetry.

By following these guidelines, a simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of the capital letter W can be created, which effectively conveys the essential features and distinctive traits of the letter.
