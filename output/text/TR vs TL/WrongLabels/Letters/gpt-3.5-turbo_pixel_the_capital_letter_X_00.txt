A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter X would consist of two diagonal lines intersecting in the center of the square canvas. The lines would extend from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. These lines would form an "X" shape, with each line being 4 pixels long and 2 pixels thick. The lines should be evenly spaced from each other, leaving a 2-pixel gap in the center where they intersect. This simplified rendition emphasizes the fundamental shape of the letter X and its distinctive trait of two diagonals crossing each other.
