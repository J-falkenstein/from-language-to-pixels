A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter Y would consist of a diagonal line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, and a shorter diagonal line from the top right corner to the bottom left corner, forming a "V" shape. The diagonal lines should start at the corners and intersect at the center pixel of the canvas. The lines should be thick enough to be visible but not so thick that they merge into a solid block. The remaining pixels in the canvas should be left empty (white or transparent) to emphasize the shape of the letter Y.
