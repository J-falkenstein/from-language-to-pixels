The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the capital letter Z can be described as follows:

The letter Z is formed by two diagonal lines, one starting from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and the other starting from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. The lines meet in the center of the pixel grid. The diagonal lines have a consistent thickness of 2 pixels. The intersection point is aligned with the central row and column of the grid. The areas outside the diagonal lines are left blank, representing the background.
