A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the letter Ä can be achieved by focusing on the basic shape and distinctive traits. 

The Ä can be best described as a combination of two parts: a small horizontal bar and a larger diagonal bar. 

The horizontal bar is positioned slightly above the center of the 8x8 grid and spans across the entire width (8 pixels). It should be placed around the 4th row to maintain proportions.

The diagonal bar starts from the top left corner of the grid (pixel 0,0) and extends towards the bottom right corner (pixel 7,7), creating a slanted line. Its placement should be such that it intersects the horizontal bar at the rightmost pixel of the line, around the 5th row.

To emphasize the Ä's unique feature, two additional pixels can be used to represent the umlaut (¨) above the diagonal bar. These dots are typically located above the intersection point of the diagonal and horizontal bars, around the 3rd row, with one dot placed slightly to the left and the other slightly to the right of the center.

Remember, in this simplified representation, intricate details should be omitted due to the limited space. Focus on capturing the essence of the Ä by incorporating the horizontal and diagonal bars, along with the umlaut dots, to create a recognizable representation within the 8x8 pixel grid.
