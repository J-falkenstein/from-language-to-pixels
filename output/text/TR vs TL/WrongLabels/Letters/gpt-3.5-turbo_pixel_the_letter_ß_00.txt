To create a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the letter ß, focus on the essential features for recognition while omitting intricate details. The fundamental shape of the letter ß can be represented as follows:

1. The top two-thirds of the 8x8 canvas should be occupied by a rectangular shape with a width of 6 pixels and a height of 5 pixels. The rectangle should be positioned towards the left side of the canvas, leaving a small gap on the right side.

2. Within the rectangle, the top left corner should be rounded smoothly, forming a quarter-circle shape occupying 2 pixels horizontally and 2 pixels vertically. The curvature should be positioned towards the top left corner of the canvas.

3. At the bottom of the rectangle, towards the right side, a descending line should be present. This line should start from the bottom left corner of the rectangle and continue diagonally towards the bottom right corner. The line should be 2 pixels long.

By using these simplified features, the essential shape and distinctive traits of the letter ß can be conveyed in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
