A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a cactus can be created by using simple geometric shapes. The cactus can be represented by a vertical rectangle shape that spans across 3 to 4 pixels, representing the main body of the cactus. The top of the cactus can be depicted by a smaller horizontal rectangle or a couple of vertical lines that extend upwards. 

To emphasize the spikes of the cactus, small diagonal lines or dots can be added along the sides of the cactus body. These spikes can be placed at regular intervals to convey the characteristic texture of a cactus. The spikes can extend upwards a few pixels above the main body of the cactus.

In terms of proportions, the height of the cactus body can be around 5 to 6 pixels, and the width can be 2 to 3 pixels. The spikes can be positioned at regular intervals, approximately 1 pixel apart.

It is important to maintain a vertical alignment for the main body of the cactus and ensure that the spikes are evenly distributed for a recognizable representation. By focusing on these essential features, other intricate details such as shading or additional branches can be omitted due to the limited space in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
