In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a cup, the fundamental shape can be depicted as an upright rectangle, with a slightly narrower base compared to the top. The top rim of the cup can be represented by a straight line across the rectangle, while the bottom can have a similar straight line, but slightly curved upwards at the center to depict the concavity of the base.

To emphasize the handle of the cup, two small curved lines can be added on the right side of the rectangle, starting from near the top rim and ending just above the base. These lines can be curved slightly towards the left to create a handle-like appearance.

The proportions of the cup can be simplified to create a recognizable representation, with a focus on the overall shape and the presence of a handle. The alignments would include the straight lines for the rim and base, and the spatial relationship would involve the position of the handle on the right side.

By emphasizing these essential features and omitting intricate details, this simplified 8x8 pixel representation can serve as a building block for creating an 8x8 pixel artwork of a cup.
