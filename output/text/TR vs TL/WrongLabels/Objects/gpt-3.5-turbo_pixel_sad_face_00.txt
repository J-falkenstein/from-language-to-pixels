In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a sad face, the fundamental shape would be a downward curve or a semi-circle to depict the mouth. The eyes could be represented as two small dots or squares positioned above the mouth, slightly towards the sides. The eyebrows can be two short horizontal lines, slightly curving downwards. The remaining pixels in the 8x8 grid can be left empty to depict a blank or neutral expression for the rest of the face.

To create an 8x8 pixel artwork of a sad face, you would align the mouth as a downward curve or semi-circle in the center of the grid, using four or five vertical pixels. The eyes would be placed above the mouth as two small dots or squares, each occupying one or two pixels, positioned towards the outer edges of the grid. The eyebrows can be two short horizontal lines, each placed above the respective eye, curving slightly downwards. 

To summarize, the simplified 8x8 pixel representation of a sad face would consist of a downward curved mouth, two small dots or squares for the eyes, and two short horizontal lines for the eyebrows. The proportions, alignments, and spatial relationships should be adjusted within the confines of the 8x8 grid to create the desired sad face expression.
