A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of an ampersand symbol can be achieved as follows:
- The symbol consists of two curves that intersect at the center of the grid.
- The upper curve starts at the top-left corner and extends diagonally to the third pixel on the rightmost column, forming a shallow "S" shape.
- The lower curve starts at the bottom-left corner and extends diagonally to the third pixel on the rightmost column, forming a mirrored "S" shape.
- The intersection point is found at the third pixel position on the bottom row, counting from the left side.
- The remaining pixels in the grid should be left blank to maintain the simplicity of the representation.
