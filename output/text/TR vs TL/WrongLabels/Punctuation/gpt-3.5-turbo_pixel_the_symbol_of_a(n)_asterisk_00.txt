The simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of an asterisk consists of a central pixel acting as the core of the symbol. Surrounding this core pixel, there are four diagonal lines that radiate outwards from the center in a star-like manner. Each diagonal line is comprised of three pixels, forming a V-shape. The four lines are evenly spaced and positioned at diagonals: one pointing up and to the right, one down and to the right, one down and to the left, and one up and to the left. All lines intersect at the central core pixel. Overall, this representation retains the essence of the asterisk symbol with its central core and radiating lines in a simplified and concise manner.
