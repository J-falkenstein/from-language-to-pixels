A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of an at sign (@) would be a vertical oval shape. The oval should fill the majority of the 8x8 pixel space, with the top and bottom edges slightly rounded. The width of the oval should be approximately 5 pixels, with the top and bottom points extending slightly outward. The center of the oval should align vertically in the middle of the 8x8 pixel space, and the left and right edges should be slightly concave, creating a distinctive curl-like effect. The space within the oval should remain empty, showcasing the background color.
