A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a backslash can be described as follows:

The backslash symbol is an angled line that slopes from the top left corner towards the bottom right corner of the 8x8 grid. It starts at the top left corner and extends diagonally, crossing the middle point of the grid and ending at the bottom right corner. The line is one pixel wide and is the only feature needed to recognize the backslash symbol. The rest of the grid should be left empty (white) to highlight the line. The proportions of the line should maintain a 45-degree angle and divide the grid into two equal triangular areas, creating a clear distinction between the top-left and bottom-right halves.
