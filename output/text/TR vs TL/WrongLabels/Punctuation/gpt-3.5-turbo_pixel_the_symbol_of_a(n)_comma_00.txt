In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a comma, the essential features for recognition are emphasized while intricate details are omitted. 

The comma symbol is represented by a curved shape resembling a small, upside-down letter "c." The top part of the symbol curves slightly downward, followed by a horizontal stroke that extends to the right. The size of the comma symbol is determined by the 8x8 pixel grid, with the height being approximately half the width to maintain proportions. 

To depict the comma symbol within this limited space, the curved shape is represented by a diagonal line connecting the bottom left and top right corners of the pixel grid. The horizontal stroke is then added by extending a line from the top right corner towards the right edge of the grid. This stroke is shorter, fitting within just a few pixels to maintain the recognizable shape.

The alignment and spatial relationship of the symbol are crucial for recognition. The curved part of the comma is positioned towards the bottom left of the grid, with the horizontal stroke extending towards the top right. This arrangement ensures that the upward curve and the horizontal stroke are visually distinct and easily recognizable as a comma symbol.

By simplifying the symbol to its fundamental shape and emphasizing its distinctive traits, this concise rendition allows for recognition of the comma symbol within the confines of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
