A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a dollar sign can be described as follows:

- The dollar sign consists of two vertical lines with a diagonal line crossing them.
- The vertical lines are positioned close to the left and right edges of the 8x8 pixel grid.
- The diagonal line starts from the top-left corner and intersects the vertical lines near their midpoints.
- The diagonal line has a slight slope towards the bottom-right corner.
- The bottom end of the diagonal line slightly extends below the intersection point with the vertical lines.
- The diagonal line should be thinner than the vertical lines to distinguish it.
- All lines are one pixel in width, emphasizing the simplicity and compactness of the symbol.
- The proportions of the vertical lines and diagonal line should be roughly equal.
- The alignment should be such that the symbol appears centered within the 8x8 grid.

Please note that due to the limited size of the 8x8 pixel grid, this simplified representation may lack intricate details such as curves or serifs. Nonetheless, it encompasses the fundamental elements necessary to recognize the symbol of a dollar sign.
