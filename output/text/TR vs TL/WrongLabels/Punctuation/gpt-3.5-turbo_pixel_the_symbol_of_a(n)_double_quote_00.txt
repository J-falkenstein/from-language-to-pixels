A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a double quote would consist of a vertical line occupying the leftmost column, with a smaller vertical line slightly shifted to the right in either the third or fourth column. The top and bottom edges of both lines would be aligned horizontally. The height of the vertical lines would cover approximately seven of the eight available vertical pixels, leaving one pixel of space between the top and bottom lines. The purpose of this simplified representation is to convey the distinctive appearance of a double quote symbol through minimalistic means.
