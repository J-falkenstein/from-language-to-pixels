In a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of an equal sign, the fundamental shape is a straight horizontal line. The line extends across the entire width of the 8 pixels, creating balance and symmetry. The thickness of the line is one pixel, defining its prominence. The top and bottom edges of the line are aligned with the top and bottom borders of the 8x8 pixel canvas, ensuring equal spacing. The symbol does not contain any curvature or inclined angles, maintaining simplicity. Overall, the simplified equal sign symbol would consist of a single straight line, one pixel thick, extending horizontally across the canvas, aligned with the edges.
