A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of an exclamation point would consist of a vertical line on the left side of the grid, occupying the first column, starting from the second row down to the seventh row. This line would span 6 pixels vertically. In terms of proportions, the vertical line would be the main feature, approximately 75% of the total height of the grid. The line would be perfectly aligned with the leftmost cell of the grid. This simplified representation would emphasize the essential feature of the exclamation point, which is a vertical line standing alone.
