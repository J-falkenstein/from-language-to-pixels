A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a greater than sign would consist of two horizontal lines. The top line, starting from the left, would be diagonal and slightly longer, slanting towards the right. It would connect to a shorter horizontal line below it, starting from the middle-right of the top line and extending straight towards the right. The top line would take up the first three pixels in the top row, while the bottom line would be placed in the middle of the second row and extend to the last three pixels in the bottom row. This simplified representation would convey the essential shape and distinctive traits of a greater than sign, allowing for easy recognition within the limited space of an 8x8 pixel artwork.
