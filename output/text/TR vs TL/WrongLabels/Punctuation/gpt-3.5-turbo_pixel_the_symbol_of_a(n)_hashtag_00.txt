In an 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a hashtag, the fundamental shape would be a square. The square should occupy the entire 8x8 pixel grid. It is important to maintain equal proportions, with each side of the square consisting of 4 pixels.

To create the hashtag effect within the square, two horizontal and two vertical lines need to be placed. The horizontal line should be positioned in the middle row, spanning the width of the square. Similarly, the vertical line should be placed in the middle column, covering the height of the square.

To ensure clarity, the lines should be slightly thicker than a single pixel. Using two adjacent pixels for each line will provide the necessary thickness.

The spatial relationship between the lines is crucial for recognition. They should intersect at the center of the square, forming four equal quadrants. The lines should be aligned and perfectly perpendicular to each other, forming right angles.

By following these guidelines, you can create a simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the hashtag symbol, highlighting its distinct shape and features while accommodating the limited space.
