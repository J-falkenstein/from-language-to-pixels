A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a left bracket can be a vertical line that extends from the top to the bottom of the pixel grid, starting at the leftmost column and centered vertically. The line should be a single pixel wide, creating a straight left edge. The height of the line should be approximately 6-7 pixels to maintain proportions. This simplified rendition will capture the essential shape of a left bracket while omitting any intricate details.
