A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol "left curly brace" can be described as follows:

- The symbol is represented by a vertical line with a slight bend towards the left at the top.
- The vertical line is positioned in the center of the 8x8 pixel grid, occupying the 4th column.
- The top of the vertical line starts at the 2nd row, and the bend towards the left occurs at the 4th row.
- The bottom of the vertical line ends at the 7th row, just one pixel above the grid's lower boundary.
- Both ends of the vertical line are aligned vertically with the center of the 8x8 pixel grid.

This simplified representation captures the essential features of a left curly brace symbol, highlighting its distinct bent shape and vertical orientation within the defined pixel space.
