A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a left parenthesis can be described as follows:

The symbol appears as an open curve resembling a half-circle, with a rounded shape. The top and bottom edges of the curve align horizontally, forming a slight arch. The left side of the curve starts slightly below the middle row, reaching upwards, while the right side of the curve ends slightly above the middle row, extending downwards. The curve occupies approximately two-thirds of the total height of the symbol, with its highest point located near the center of the height. The remaining one-third of the height above and below the curve consists of empty pixels, representing the opening of the parenthesis. The width of the curve is uniform and takes up the full width of the symbol.
