A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a less than sign can be described as a left-facing arrow shape. It consists of a vertical line on the left side that extends from the top edge to the bottom edge of the pixel grid. From the bottom end of this vertical line, a diagonal line slopes towards the top right corner of the grid, crossing the horizontal line that is located close to the bottom edge. This diagonal line is shorter in length compared to the vertical line. The top right corner of the grid remains empty. The proportions of the vertical line and diagonal line can be adjusted to ensure the recognition of the less than sign within the space constraints.
