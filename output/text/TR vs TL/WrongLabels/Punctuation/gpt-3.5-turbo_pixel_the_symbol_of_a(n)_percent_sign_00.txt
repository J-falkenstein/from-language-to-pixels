A simplified 8x8 representation of the symbol of a percent sign can be created by emphasizing the essential features while omitting intricate details. The symbol consists of a vertical line extending from the top to the bottom of the canvas, positioned slightly left of the center. At the top of the vertical line, a small half circle curves towards the right, connecting to the vertical line at a point slightly below its middle. This half circle represents the top loop of the percent sign. The bottom loop, which is larger, starts from the same point where the top loop connects to the vertical line. It curves downwards towards the right, connecting back to the vertical line at a point slightly below its middle. The bottom loop is wider than the top loop and has a rounder shape to create a visually distinctive trait. The proportions of the loops can be adjusted to fit the 8x8 pixel grid, ensuring that they are recognizable and distinguishable. The vertical line maintains a consistent thickness throughout.
