A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a plus sign would consist of four horizontal and vertical lines intersecting each other at the center point. The lines would be one pixel thick, forming a cross shape. The horizontal lines would be located in the middle row and the vertical lines would be located in the middle column. The lines would extend from the left edge to the right edge and from the top edge to the bottom edge. The length of each line would be six pixels. The plus sign would be symmetrical and centered within the 8x8 pixel grid.
