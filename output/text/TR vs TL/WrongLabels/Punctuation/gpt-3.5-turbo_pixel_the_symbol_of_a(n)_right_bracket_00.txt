A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a right bracket can be created as follows:

The right bracket is a vertical line extending from the top edge of the pixel canvas to the bottom edge, aligned to the right side of the canvas. It occupies the entire height of the canvas, which is 8 pixels in this case. The width of the right bracket is a single pixel. The top pixel of the right bracket is filled, while the rest of the pixels below it are left empty. This creates a distinct vertical line that represents the right bracket symbol.
