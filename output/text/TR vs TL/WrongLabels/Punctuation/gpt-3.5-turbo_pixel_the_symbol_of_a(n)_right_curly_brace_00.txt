A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a right curly brace can be achieved by representing the essential features and omitting intricate details. The symbol typically consists of a vertically elongated shape with a curved top and bottom. 

To create the simplified artwork, start by drawing a vertical line that spans across the height of the 8x8 pixel canvas. This line represents the central pillar of the right curly brace. Next, draw two diagonal lines starting from the top-left corner and joining the central pillar at the top. These lines form the curved top of the brace. Similarly, draw two diagonal lines starting from the bottom-left corner and joining the central pillar at the bottom, creating the curved bottom of the brace.

To ensure proper proportions and alignment, the central pillar should be slightly thinner than the diagonal lines representing the top and bottom curves. The diagonal lines should be aligned such that they connect smoothly to the central pillar without any visible gaps.

The simplified representation should convey the unmistakable shape of a right curly brace with its distinct curved top and bottom, while staying within the constraints of an 8x8 pixel canvas.
