A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a right parenthesis can be achieved by focusing on the basic shape and proportions. The symbol can be represented as a filled-in circle with a slightly curved right side. It should be centered within the 8x8 canvas, with the bottom edge aligned with the center row. The left side of the circle should be straight, while the right side should curve gently towards the center. Omit any shading or variations in color, as the simplified representation should only consist of a single solid color. By capturing these essential features, the simplified 8x8 pixel artwork of a right parenthesis can be recognized.
