A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a semicolon can be described as follows:

The symbol consists of two parts: a dot and a curved line. In the 8x8 pixel grid, the dot can be represented by a dark pixel located at the top right corner. The curved line starts from the top left corner, extending diagonally towards the bottom right corner. It follows a gentle curve, sloping slightly downwards and to the right. The line occupies the bottom six rows of the grid, starting from the second row and ending in the seventh row. The line terminates just before reaching the bottom right corner. The dot and the curved line are not connected and have a slight separation of one pixel. The width of the line is one pixel, while the dot has a diameter of one pixel. Overall, the symbol of a semicolon in this simplified representation is recognizable through the combination of the dot and the curved line, conveying the essence of its shape in a minimalistic form.
