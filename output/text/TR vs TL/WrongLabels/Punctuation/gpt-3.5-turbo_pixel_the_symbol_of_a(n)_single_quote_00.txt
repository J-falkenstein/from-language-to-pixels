A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of a single quote can be described as follows:

The symbol is represented by a vertical line, positioned slightly to the left side of the pixel grid. The line is 3 pixels tall and takes up the center column of the 8x8 grid. The topmost pixel of the line is slightly offset to the left, creating a slanted appearance. The bottom pixel of the line is also slightly offset to the left, creating a similar slant. The remaining two pixels in the line are aligned vertically. The line does not touch the top or bottom edges of the grid, allowing for a slight space above and below. This simplified representation captures the key elements of the single quote symbol while utilizing the limited space available in an 8x8 pixel artwork.
