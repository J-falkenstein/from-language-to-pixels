A simplified 8x8 pixel representation of the symbol of an underscore would consist of a straight horizontal line spanning the entire width of the grid. It should be positioned at the bottom of the grid, occupying the bottom row of pixels. The line should be one pixel in thickness and evenly aligned with the edges of the grid. The remaining seven rows above the underscore line should be left blank or filled with any neutral color. This representation effectively captures the fundamental shape and distinctive trait of an underscore symbol within the given space constraints.
