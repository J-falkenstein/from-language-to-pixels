The black pixels are represented by 1s and the white pixels are represented by 0s. In this example, the pixels are arranged in such a way that they form the shape of the number 7.

Each pixel in the matrix corresponds to a specific location on the screen. By turning on or off certain pixels, we can create different patterns and shapes that represent different objects.

This pixel matrix representation is used in various applications, such as computer graphics, image processing, and display technologies. It allows us to digitally represent objects and display them on screens in a way that is visually understandable to humans.
